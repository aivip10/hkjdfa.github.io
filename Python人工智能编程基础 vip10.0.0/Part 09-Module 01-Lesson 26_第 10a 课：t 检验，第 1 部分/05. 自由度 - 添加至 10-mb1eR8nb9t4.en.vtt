00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:08.900
Let's say n is 4, so we have x1 plus x2 all the way to x4 has to equal 10.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.230
Let's choose a number, any number. I like the number 13. What does this mean?

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.561
That means that x2 plus x3 plus x4 has to equal 10 minus 13, so it has to equal

00:00:17.561 --> 00:00:25.266
negative 3. Okay, let's pick another number. I like the number 8. So, so far

00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:32.494
we've chosen that x1 is 13, x2 is 8. This means that x3 plus x4 equals negative

00:00:32.494 --> 00:00:38.785
3 minus 8, which is negative 11. We can still choose another value for x3 or

00:00:38.785 --> 00:00:44.321
x4. I like the number three so let's say x3 is 3 and now what is that mean, x4

00:00:44.321 --> 00:00:49.505
must equal negative 11 minus 3 which is negative 14, so x4 has been forced, but

00:00:49.505 --> 00:00:54.689
I was able to choose these three, there were four numbers to start out with and

00:00:54.689 --> 00:01:04.099
I have three degrees of freedom. If we have n numbers, we have n minus 1

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:07.659
degrees of freedom. Good job!
