00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.345
This is the solutions video for the vector lab,

00:00:03.345 --> 00:00:07.409
covering adding two vectors and plotting their results.

00:00:07.408 --> 00:00:11.910
First, we need to replace none with the definition of vector v w

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.469
by adding vector w to vector v. Here,

00:00:16.469 --> 00:00:20.864
we've coded v w equals v plus w,

00:00:20.864 --> 00:00:23.324
and we mark this task as done.

00:00:23.324 --> 00:00:30.405
Next, we need to copy the arrow statement from vector v and place it here,

00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:39.260
replacing vector v with vector v w. Color equals b with color equals k,

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:44.884
linewidth equal 2.5 with linewidth equal 3.5.

00:00:44.884 --> 00:00:48.920
This will plot vector v w as

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:56.194
the thick black arrow in the plot down here so that it matches our solution here.

00:00:56.194 --> 00:01:00.469
Next, we click on the "Save" icon to save our work.

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:02.615
Then, we select "Kernel",

00:01:02.615 --> 00:01:06.320
"Restart &amp; Run All" to run all the code in

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:10.000
the cells and visualize the changes that we've made to the plot.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.194
Finally, we compare our plot to the solution.

00:01:15.194 --> 00:01:17.234
And we can see, since they match,

00:01:17.234 --> 00:01:19.049
we've coded everything correctly.

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.929
This completes this section of the lab.
