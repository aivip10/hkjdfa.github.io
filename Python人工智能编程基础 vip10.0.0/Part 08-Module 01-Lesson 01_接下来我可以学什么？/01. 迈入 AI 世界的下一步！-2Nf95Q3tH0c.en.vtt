00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.120
Congratulations!

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.835
You finished your first Nanodegree, in the school of AI.

00:00:06.835 --> 00:00:10.503
You're now hopefully feeling confident with Python,

00:00:10.503 --> 00:00:16.994
and some of the available libraries it offers.You know so much about neural networks.

00:00:16.995 --> 00:00:18.885
Finished your first project,

00:00:18.885 --> 00:00:21.435
and created an image classifier.

00:00:21.434 --> 00:00:24.134
You have done remarkably well.

00:00:24.135 --> 00:00:26.115
It's only been a few years,

00:00:26.114 --> 00:00:32.089
since deep neural networks have been shown to classify images as well as we humans do.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.030
A short while ago, this would have sounded like science fiction.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.914
Yet, you just did that.

00:00:37.914 --> 00:00:42.125
The ride was probably not an easy one. But, you made it.

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:45.375
You're now ready to continue your AI journey,

00:00:45.375 --> 00:00:48.045
and become an expert.

00:00:48.045 --> 00:00:51.130
You may feel that this Nanodegree program,

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.960
has satisfied your curiosity or that the skills you have acquired,

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.189
are just enough to meet your goals.

00:00:58.189 --> 00:01:00.924
But, if we gave you an appetite for more,

00:01:00.924 --> 00:01:03.809
and you would like to become an AI expert,

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.975
Udacity and Udacity School of AI,

00:01:06.974 --> 00:01:10.444
offer you many different programs to choose from.

00:01:10.444 --> 00:01:12.854
If you want to take it to the next step,

00:01:12.855 --> 00:01:14.980
and learn more about Deep Learning,

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.290
the Deep Learning Nanodegree Program,

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.135
will be a great choice.

00:01:19.135 --> 00:01:21.340
We will teach you many topics,

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.020
such as recurrent neural networks,

00:01:24.019 --> 00:01:26.314
which focus on sequences of data.

00:01:26.314 --> 00:01:29.989
They're essentially neural networks with memory.

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:32.500
One of the projects we will focus on,

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.555
is teaching a quadcopter how to fly.

00:01:35.555 --> 00:01:38.600
In the Machine Learning Nanodegree program,

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:42.919
you'll master skills that are in demand across countless industries.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.295
You will learn about supervised learning,

00:01:45.295 --> 00:01:48.185
unsupervised learning and much more.

00:01:48.185 --> 00:01:49.790
One of the projects,

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.500
will be to create your own, dog breed classifier.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.655
If you want to learn more specific topics,

00:01:56.655 --> 00:02:00.665
we also offer a Computer Vision, Nanodegree program.

00:02:00.665 --> 00:02:05.460
In this nanodegree, you will learn how machines process images and videos,

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:10.299
for applications that include object recognition and localization,

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.469
image captioning, scene understanding,

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:16.185
and tracking of objects in videos.

00:02:16.185 --> 00:02:19.810
In the Natural Language Processing Nanodegree program,

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.314
you will learn about machine learning systems,

00:02:22.314 --> 00:02:24.675
that understand natural language.

00:02:24.675 --> 00:02:28.340
Like, text extracted from an article or a blog,

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:35.879
machine translation, text summarization and voice user interfaces like Amazon's Alexa.

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:40.194
Udacity, also offers more Nanodegree programs.

00:02:40.194 --> 00:02:44.680

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.920
check out our self-driving engineer program.

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:52.194
We also offer flying cars and autonomous flight,

00:02:52.194 --> 00:02:57.129
robotic software engineer, and many other Nanodegree programs.

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:59.659
It has been our honor teaching you.

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:01.439
We wish you the best of luck,
