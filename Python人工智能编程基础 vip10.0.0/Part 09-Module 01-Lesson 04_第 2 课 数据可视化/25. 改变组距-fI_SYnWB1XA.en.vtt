00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.399
We're going to go deeper into understanding the shapes of distributions.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.091
Interactivate has its own data sets that you can play around with, so let's

00:00:11.103 --> 00:00:15.968
check out Body Fat percentage of 252 Men. Here, you can see that it looks like

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:22.471
it has on peak, pretty much right in the middle. And if we change the shape of

00:00:22.483 --> 00:00:30.176
the distribution, you can see it always peaks about here. At maybe 21% body fat.

00:00:30.325 --> 00:00:38.155
Again, sometimes when the bin size is too small, you can see it's really, really

00:00:38.167 --> 00:00:44.555
small Then, there's a little too much detail. And when the interval size is too

00:00:44.567 --> 00:00:50.805
big, there's not enough detail. This is probably a pretty good bin size around

00:00:50.817 --> 00:00:56.835
this area. Let's stop at about here with the bin size 2.662. Now, let's take a

00:00:56.847 --> 00:00:57.220
quiz.
