00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.178
Here's all the data. This time, I'm going to provide the means and standard

00:00:04.178 --> 00:00:07.952
deviations. But go ahead and calculate these if you feel like you need

00:00:07.952 --> 00:00:13.196
additional practice. Again, we'll do a two-tailed test to see if the effects of

00:00:13.196 --> 00:00:17.750
these two drugs are significantly different. That means, that the null

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.170
hypothesis, is that the population of those who use drug A will not be

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:27.330
significantly different from the population that you use B. And the alternative

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.904
hypothesis is that they will be significantly different. First, calculate the

00:00:31.904 --> 00:00:32.870
t-statistic.
