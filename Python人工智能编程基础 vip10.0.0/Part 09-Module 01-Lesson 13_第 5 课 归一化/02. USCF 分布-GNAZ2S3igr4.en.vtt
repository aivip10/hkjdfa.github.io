00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.667
If we look at just the US Chess Federation.

00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:06.266
This is the rating distribution as of 2004.

00:00:06.433 --> 00:00:10.467
Bear in mind that the first bin is about 200,

00:00:10.467 --> 00:00:13.000
Whereas all the other bins are size 100.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.834
If my rating is 1800,

00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:19.700
then I am about 8110th place in the US,

00:00:20.033 --> 00:00:23.100
But this is better than approximately 88%.

00:00:23.242 --> 00:00:27.838
Therefore, another really important thing about the shape of distributions. And

00:00:27.838 --> 00:00:32.394
what we're interested in throughout the rest of this course is the proportion of

00:00:32.394 --> 00:00:36.772
data values, less than or greater than a certain value in the data set. So if I

00:00:36.772 --> 00:00:41.056
tell you that my rating is 1800, you really don't know what that means until I

00:00:41.056 --> 00:00:45.022
tell you the shape of the distribution of ratings. And you can see the

00:00:45.022 --> 00:00:46.050
proportion less.
