00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.876
The location of particular values on the X axis is often described in terms of

00:00:04.876 --> 00:00:09.699
standard deviations. Here you can see this is the mean, this is the mean plus

00:00:09.699 --> 00:00:14.487
one standard deviation, this is the mean plus two standard deviations, and

00:00:14.487 --> 00:00:19.503
likewise, this is the mean minus one standard deviation and minus two standard

00:00:19.503 --> 00:00:24.677
deviations. Whatever score we might have, we can convert it to a value equal to

00:00:24.677 --> 00:00:29.762
the number of standard deviations away from the mean. Let's call it z. By

00:00:29.762 --> 00:00:35.290
converting scores in a normal distribution to this special number z. We can know

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.662
the percent less than or greater than that value. For example, if we find that a

00:00:40.662 --> 00:00:45.977
value is one standard deviation away from the mean. Then no matter what normal

00:00:45.977 --> 00:00:51.409
distribution we have. We know that approximately 84 percent are less than that

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:56.213
value. In the next lesson, you'll learn how to calculate the proportions less

00:00:56.213 --> 00:01:00.881
than or greater than certain values in a normal distribution. What's an example

00:01:00.881 --> 00:01:04.952
in which we might want to know the proportion less than or greater than a

00:01:04.952 --> 00:01:08.662
particular number? Let's illustrate this with another story.
