00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.952
Well, since the sample had average engagement ratio of 0.13 we would guess that

00:00:05.952 --> 00:00:11.698
the population will have an engagement ratio of 0.13. This means that on average

00:00:11.698 --> 00:00:16.582
out of every hour of content available students would watch almost 8 minutes if

00:00:16.582 --> 00:00:21.770
we introduced this new lesson with a song. Remember that since the distribution

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.984
is skewed the number of minutes students would watch is heavily pulled towards

00:00:26.984 --> 00:00:31.961
the left, towards zero, because there are probably a lot of students who are

00:00:31.961 --> 00:00:37.216
enrolled but aren't watching any of the lessons. Of the students that are taking

00:00:37.216 --> 00:00:42.280
the course and progressing through it this number would be a lot higher. But on

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.900
average it's about eight minutes.
