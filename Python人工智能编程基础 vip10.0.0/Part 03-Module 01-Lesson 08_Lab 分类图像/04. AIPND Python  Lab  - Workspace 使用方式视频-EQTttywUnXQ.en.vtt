00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.969
I'm going to demonstrate how to work within the Lab Workspace.

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:08.425
Click on the three blue bars in the left upper corner.

00:00:08.425 --> 00:00:10.585
This opens up the Navigation Pane,

00:00:10.585 --> 00:00:15.387
scroll down until you see the Lab Workspace and click on it.

00:00:15.387 --> 00:00:19.660
This opens up your Lab Workspace.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.059
It's composed of three sections.

00:00:22.059 --> 00:00:24.849
The first section has the files.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.900
The second section is where you open and edit files.

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:30.339
The third section allows you to open

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:34.045
terminal windows so that you can run your Python programs.

00:00:34.045 --> 00:00:37.890
Let's open a Terminal window by clicking on the plus.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.125
While the Terminal window initializes,

00:00:41.125 --> 00:00:44.594
let's expand the Edit window.

00:00:44.594 --> 00:00:47.122
If I click on check images,

00:00:47.122 --> 00:00:52.614
this brings it up in the Edit window and then I can add my name beside

00:00:52.615 --> 00:01:00.000
programmer and it automatically saves it.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.564
So, now check images has my name in it.

00:01:03.564 --> 00:01:07.314
So when you're editing check images for the lab,

00:01:07.314 --> 00:01:10.709
the changes you make in this program are automatically saved.

00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:12.774
To run this program Check Images,

00:01:12.775 --> 00:01:19.165
you go to the Terminal window and just type Python space check.

00:01:19.165 --> 00:01:20.859
And then if you hit tab,

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:22.420
you'll get tab completion,

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.984
which will complete the file name and you can hit enter and it will run the program.

00:01:27.984 --> 00:01:34.465
While it's running, let's go back and look at the files in our directory here.

00:01:34.465 --> 00:01:36.969
We have the pet images folder.

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:38.289
If I click on it,

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.180
I see all the pet images.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:48.719
To go back, I click on the arrow up here and it puts me back in that Workspace directory.

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:53.905
The only file I should be changing in here is check images.

00:01:53.905 --> 00:01:57.109
If I want to close check images out,

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:59.329
I just hit the X and it closes out.

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:03.724
If I want to open up something else like dognames.txt,

00:02:03.724 --> 00:02:07.174
I click on it and it opens in this Edit window.

00:02:07.175 --> 00:02:13.444
Let's say I make a mistake and I accidentally delete or change dognames.txt.

00:02:13.443 --> 00:02:15.694
So, if I right click and hit Delete,

00:02:15.694 --> 00:02:19.846
I will delete it and all of a sudden it's gone.

00:02:19.846 --> 00:02:23.825
To be able to bring dog names back,

00:02:23.824 --> 00:02:25.789
I need to reset my environment,

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:26.959
but when I reset,

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.870
it's going to set back to the original state,

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.259
which will mean the change that I made in

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:35.644
check images by adding my name is going to disappear.

00:02:35.645 --> 00:02:38.030
So, to keep from losing check images,

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.305
I need to download it.

00:02:39.305 --> 00:02:40.819
I click on Check Images,

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:50.594
do right click and Download and it will download to my Downloads folder on my laptop.

00:02:50.594 --> 00:02:53.974
We can also see here that our program finished running,

00:02:53.974 --> 00:02:58.519
total elapsed runtime is none, that's expected.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.590
This demonstrates how to run your Python program within this Workspace.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:09.620
Our file is downloaded so now we can safely reset the Workspace to its original state.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.819
I hit Menu and then Reset Data to

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:18.079
reset your data because you're overwriting everything that you've worked on,

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:27.050
you need to type in Reset data and make sure you have a lower case D,

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.880
once it's typed correctly it'll initialize this button,

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:33.840
you hit it and it resets all the data.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.215
So, now I would expect that I see dog names is back and if I click on it, there it is.

00:03:39.215 --> 00:03:41.539
So, it's reset back to its original state.

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:45.289
If I click on check images,

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:47.750
I see that I don't see my name typed

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.104
in here because it's the original state of the program.

00:03:50.104 --> 00:03:52.669
To bring my edited program back,

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:55.564
I just click on check images, right click,

00:03:55.564 --> 00:03:59.539
and do Delete and then I delete it.

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:05.689
And now, I click on this plus and hit Upload File.

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:09.109
And I go to my Downloads directory,

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.135
click on check images,

00:04:11.134 --> 00:04:18.149
open, and it uploads that file that I edited back to my Workspace.

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:19.534
If I double click on it,

00:04:19.535 --> 00:04:22.995
there it is Jennifer S, that's me.

00:04:22.995 --> 00:04:26.158
And this is that file that I edited.

00:04:26.158 --> 00:04:29.930
I would recommend that you download

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.405
your check images file before you do the reset so that you save your work.

00:04:34.404 --> 00:04:38.779
You can also upload other files you want to the Workspace by using

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:43.629
the plus and then upload a file or upload a folder.

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:46.189
So, to go back to the lessons,

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:49.850
I simply click on the three bars on

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:55.750
the upper left corner that opens the navigation pane and then I pick my lesson.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.964
I'm going back to Workspace How-to,

00:04:57.964 --> 00:05:00.209
click on it and it opens back up.

00:05:00.209 --> 00:05:01.444
And if I want to expand that,

00:05:01.444 --> 00:05:07.269
I click on these three bars again and expands my Workspace How-to,

00:05:07.269 --> 00:05:09.359
to be full screen.
