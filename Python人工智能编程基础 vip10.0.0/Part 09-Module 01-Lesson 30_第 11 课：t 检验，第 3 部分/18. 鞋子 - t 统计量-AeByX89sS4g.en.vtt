00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.618
Now that we have the standard error, let's calculate the t-statistic. Calculate

00:00:04.618 --> 00:00:08.950
the positive value. So let's do the average number of shoes owned by females

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:14.280
minus that for males, and then divide it by the standard error. What do you

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:14.730
get?
