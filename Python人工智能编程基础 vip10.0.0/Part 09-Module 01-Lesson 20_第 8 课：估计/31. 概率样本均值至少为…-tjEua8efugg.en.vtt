00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.166
We have to use the z table and the z scores that we just calculated. With the z

00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:10.524
value this high, the probability of getting the z score is off the charts. It's

00:00:10.524 --> 00:00:16.990
so low that it's near impossible. However, the probability of getting a z score

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:23.375
of 0.92 is 1 minus the probability that we get less then a z score of 0.92. So,

00:00:23.375 --> 00:00:28.507
let's look at the z table for that. So here's 0.9, and this would be the

00:00:28.507 --> 00:00:35.995
probability of getting a z score less than 0.92, 0.8212. And so, the probability

00:00:35.995 --> 00:00:41.325
of getting a z square greater than this, which is the same as the probability of

00:00:41.325 --> 00:00:47.460
getting a mean greater than 8.35, is about 0.18. This probability is a lot

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.035
greater than this one.
