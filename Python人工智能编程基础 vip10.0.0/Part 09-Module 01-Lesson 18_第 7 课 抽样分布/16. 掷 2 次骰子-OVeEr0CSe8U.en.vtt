00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.770
If you use the app and then you select two dice, you might notice that this

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:11.660
scale goes from two to twelve and that's because this app sums up the two rolls.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.535
But this is still the same concept because when you take the average, you sum up

00:00:16.535 --> 00:00:21.430
the two rolls and then you just divide by two. So, the distribution will look

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.536
exactly the same pretty much as what is shown here. Except the scale will just

00:00:26.536 --> 00:00:31.016
be these numbers divided by two. But the important thing is that the shape of

00:00:31.016 --> 00:00:37.310
the distribution will be the same. So let's roll 2 dice once. So we get that the

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:43.390
sum is 9, which means that the average would be 4.5. If we roll again we would

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:50.054
get that the average is 3 and the sum is 6. And we can keep doing this a number

00:00:50.054 --> 00:00:56.646
of times and you see that the more we roll the dice and plot the distribution of

00:00:56.646 --> 00:01:02.634
the sums or the averages, it looks more and more normal. Play around with this

00:01:02.634 --> 00:01:05.163
applet because it's a really good learning tool.
