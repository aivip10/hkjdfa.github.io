00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.617
These are three ways of symbolizing the alternative hypothesis. And in real

00:00:04.617 --> 00:00:09.630
terms, this is like saying, the intervention will make learners more engaged.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.438
In other words, the population parameter after the intervention will be greater

00:00:13.438 --> 00:00:17.861
than the current population parameter. Or it'll change how much learners are

00:00:17.861 --> 00:00:22.790
engaged. Which is symbolized by this way of writing the alternative hypothesis,

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.947
or will make learners less engaged. Our next step is to decide which of these

00:00:27.947 --> 00:00:30.733
alternative hypotheses we want.
