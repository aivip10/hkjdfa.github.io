Let's say we reject the null, that means we think it's going to rain. That

00:00:04.454 --> 00:00:08.816
means we're going to bring our umbrella. Alternatively, if we retain the null,

00:00:08.816 --> 00:00:13.904
we decide it's not going to rain, then we won't bring our umbrella. Remember

00:00:13.904 --> 00:00:17.500
that, these two rejecting the null or retaining the null correspond to our

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.358
decision. If the null is true, meaning that it's not going to rain, then we

00:00:22.358 --> 00:00:28.820
should put A here. And if the null is false, that means it rains. Hopefully,

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.133
this helped illustrate the concept of type one and type two errors.
