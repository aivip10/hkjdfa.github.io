00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.351
So remember, we're taking this distribution. We're shifting it all the way over

00:00:05.351 --> 00:00:11.165
to zero because we're subtracting the mean. So basically, if we have a normal

00:00:11.165 --> 00:00:16.350
distribution out here with a mean of 100, if we subtract the mean, we shift

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:23.653
this distribution to the left 100. And then, the new mean is 0. What if we add

00:00:23.653 --> 00:00:28.891
a distribution with a mean of, say negative 30? If we subtract negative 30,

00:00:28.891 --> 00:00:34.951
then we're essentially adding 30. And we shift the distribution right, again,

00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:39.550
centering at 0. Another way to look at it is, what's going to be the new

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:45.417
z-score of the mean? Let's say that the mean is x. The z-score of the mean is

00:00:45.417 --> 00:00:51.805
basically how many standard deviations away from the mean is the mean. Well,

00:00:51.805 --> 00:00:57.680
that's 0 instead of x, we have mu. Mu minus mu divided by standard deviation is

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.843
0 divided by the standard deviation, which is just 0. So, that's another way to

00:01:03.843 --> 00:01:05.630
look at it.
