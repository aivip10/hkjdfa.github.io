&gt;&gt; How would you define happiness? &gt;&gt; Being at peace. &gt;&gt; The ability to , I

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:15.464
guess live a fulfilled life. &gt;&gt; It's more what you feel. What you can bring to

00:00:15.476 --> 00:00:20.093
others and not so much what you see. &gt;&gt; They kind of bounce. Their eyes get all

00:00:20.105 --> 00:00:24.273
happy. Their ears kind of go up. They get all loose, like their body language is

00:00:24.285 --> 00:00:28.959
real loose. and yeah, their tails wag, like he's happy right now. &gt;&gt; How would

00:00:28.971 --> 00:00:32.200
you measure it? &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't know, I, I don't measure nothin' really.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.119
&gt;&gt; I just I'm happy.

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:38.765
&gt;&gt; I think I'd probably measure it by the number of times I smile every day. &gt;&gt;

00:00:38.767 --> 00:00:43.105
I have no idea. I'd have to think about that for a sec. &gt;&gt; Their, their

00:00:43.117 --> 00:00:47.460
attitude. Their, just the way they are personally. &gt;&gt; If I was a researcher and

00:00:47.472 --> 00:00:52.202
I wanted to know how well you remembered something how could I do that? &gt;&gt; If

00:00:52.214 --> 00:00:57.683
you're talking about like say, scientific experimentation. To have a control of

00:00:57.695 --> 00:01:03.165
some sort, you could film the experience that a person has and then interview

00:01:03.177 --> 00:01:08.449
that person. maybe have multiple people to interview, so you get different

00:01:08.461 --> 00:01:13.931
points of view for the same event. And see how that differs. &gt;&gt; How would you

00:01:13.943 --> 00:01:21.240
define memory? &gt;&gt;, &gt;&gt; It's an accumulation of information, data. far more

00:01:21.252 --> 00:01:27.805
important is how you apply that, how you use it? &gt;&gt; The ability to retrieve

00:01:27.817 --> 00:01:34.954
information from your past. &gt;&gt; I have to think about it. &gt;&gt; Things I bothered to

00:01:34.966 --> 00:01:37.755
remember for &gt;&gt; Later use.

00:01:37.755 --> 00:01:44.312
&gt;&gt; How would you define itchiness? &gt;&gt; Discomfort, yeah just general discomfort.

00:01:44.312 --> 00:01:51.297
&gt;&gt; Something that's irritating you, and you have to scratch it. &gt;&gt; The intensity

00:01:51.309 --> 00:01:57.437
of the itch would match the time length of scratching. &gt;&gt; With the amount that

00:01:57.449 --> 00:02:02.087
they move around. &gt;&gt; You could ask a very forward question, like is there

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:04.996
something you need me to scratch? Right now.

00:02:04.996 --> 00:02:09.684
&gt;&gt; Well that sounds a little personal. &gt;&gt; Very close friend, maybe you could do

00:02:09.696 --> 00:02:14.067
that. &gt;&gt; So kind of like happiness if you had to measure how itchy your dog was

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:18.511
right now, how would you do that? &gt;&gt; How would you quantify it? &gt;&gt; I'm going to

00:02:18.885 --> 00:02:22.887
I'd, I'd definitely go with, like, how often they were scratching, or how often

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:27.466
they were doing sort of a full body shake. &gt;&gt; How would you measure stress? &gt;&gt; I

00:02:27.478 --> 00:02:31.351
think you could measure stress by, obviously, there's, I'm sure medical ways

00:02:31.363 --> 00:02:35.656
that you could measure stress. &gt;&gt; Yeah, the frown on my face, on my, on my mouth

00:02:35.668 --> 00:02:37.609
I mean. &gt;&gt; Heartbeats probably.

00:02:37.625 --> 00:02:39.059
The blood rushing to the head.
