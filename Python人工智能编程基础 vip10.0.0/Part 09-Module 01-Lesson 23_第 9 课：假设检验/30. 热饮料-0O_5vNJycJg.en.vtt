00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.362
Let's go through a simple example of type one and type two errors. Have you

00:00:04.362 --> 00:00:08.119
ever sipped a beverage that was too hot, and you burned your tongue? Let's say

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:12.570
that the null hypothesis is that the beverage is fine to drink. It's not too

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.600
hot, it's perfect. The alternative hypothesis then, is that the beverage is too

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.524
hot to drink. So, now, four things can happen. One thing, which often happens

00:00:22.524 --> 00:00:25.926
to me, because I'm hasty, is you decide the beverage is fine to drink but then

00:00:25.926 --> 00:00:31.192
it's too hot and you burn your toungue. Another thing that could happen is you

00:00:31.192 --> 00:00:35.350
decide that the beverage is fine to drink now and indeed it is, then you enjoy

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.680
drinking it. Another thing that can happen is you think the beverage is too hot

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.344
now so you wait until it cools but it's actually fine to drink, and then by the

00:00:43.344 --> 00:00:48.858
time you drink it it's cold. And finally, you might think the beverage is too

00:00:48.858 --> 00:00:52.398
hot, and indeed it is, so you wait to drink it, and then by the time you do,

00:00:52.398 --> 00:00:59.300
it's perfect. Now put A, B, C, or D, in the respective boxes it belongs here,

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.803
and remember what H not, and H a are.
