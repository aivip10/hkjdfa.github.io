00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.032
Certainly, looking at whether the sample means are higher or lower than the

00:00:04.032 --> 00:00:08.192
population means provides some indication of whether or not the song may have

00:00:08.192 --> 00:00:12.790
helped or hurt student engagement and learning. But this barely tells the whole

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.085
story. We could look at the difference between the population mean and sample

00:00:17.085 --> 00:00:21.245
mean, but the population is based on thousands of scores, whereas the sample

00:00:21.245 --> 00:00:26.052
mean is based off of just 20 scores. So this isn't an accurate comparison. We

00:00:26.052 --> 00:00:30.688
also can't find the z score of a sample mean using the population standard

00:00:30.688 --> 00:00:35.704
deviation sigma, because sigma is based on the variability of each individual

00:00:35.704 --> 00:00:41.422
score, not the variability of a mean of scores. Therefore, the third option is

00:00:41.422 --> 00:00:46.842
correct. Using the central limit theorem, we need to look at the distribution of

00:00:46.842 --> 00:00:51.600
sample means for all samples of size 20, and then find where our two sample

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.053
means fall on these distributions.
