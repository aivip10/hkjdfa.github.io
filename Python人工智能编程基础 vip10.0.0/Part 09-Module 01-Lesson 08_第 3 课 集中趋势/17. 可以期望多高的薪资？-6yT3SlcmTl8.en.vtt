00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.775
&gt;&gt; I think we can say with confidence that this average is misleading. That's

00:00:04.775 --> 00:00:09.549
because, if you look at the data, all of these guys are less than 123,098, in

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:14.767
fact, significantly less. The average can be misleading when we have outliers.

00:00:14.767 --> 00:00:20.076
Values that are unexpectedly different from the other observed values. Outliers

00:00:20.076 --> 00:00:25.021
create skewed distributions by pulling the mean toward the outlier. This makes

00:00:25.021 --> 00:00:28.780
the mean a lot less representative of the middle of the data.
