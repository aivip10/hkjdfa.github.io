00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.549
Since z equals the original value minus the mean, divided by standard deviation.

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.675
In other words, the number of standard deviations that the original value is

00:00:10.675 --> 00:00:15.883
from the mean. Then a negative z score means that, the mean is greater than x.

00:00:15.883 --> 00:00:20.894
That must mean that x is somewhere down here. So that doesn't necessarily mean

00:00:20.894 --> 00:00:25.825
that the original value is negative, though it could be. It does mean that the

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:31.057
original value is less than the mean. The original value is less than zero, it

00:00:31.057 --> 00:00:36.327
basically says the same thing as this first one, that the original value is

00:00:36.327 --> 00:00:41.585
negative. In this one, the original value x minus the mean is negative, must

00:00:41.585 --> 00:00:47.048
also be true. Because for the z score to be negative, then this is going to be

00:00:47.048 --> 00:00:52.741
negative, because the standard deviation is always positive. Just to review,

00:00:52.741 --> 00:00:58.430
remember when we calculated standard deviation, we squared all the deviations.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.944
So all the deviations are then positive, because if you square anything negative

00:01:03.944 --> 00:01:08.861
or positive, you get a positive number. And then we just took the average

00:01:08.861 --> 00:01:14.126
squared deviation, which is still positive, and then we took the square root,

00:01:14.126 --> 00:01:19.396
which is still positive. So remember that this standard deviation will always be

00:01:19.396 --> 00:01:24.511
positive. Which means that if the z score is negative, then this numerator must

00:01:24.511 --> 00:01:27.981
be negative. And that must mean that x is less than mu.
