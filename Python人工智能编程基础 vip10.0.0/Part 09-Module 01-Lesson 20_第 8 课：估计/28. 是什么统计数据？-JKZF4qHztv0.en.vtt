00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.780
Now ultimately we want to know if hearing this song, on hypothesis testing in

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:09.655
lesson nine, will result in higher engagement and learning. So what statistic

00:00:09.655 --> 00:00:14.494
should we calculate to determine this? Should we simply note whether or not the

00:00:14.494 --> 00:00:18.730
sample means are less than or greater than the population mean? Or should we

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.694
calculate the actual difference between the population mean and the sample mean

00:00:23.694 --> 00:00:28.220
for each measure, or should we found out where each sample mean falls on the

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.965
distribution of sample means from each population, or should we find how many

00:00:32.965 --> 00:00:37.843
population standard deviations each sample mean is from the population mean?
