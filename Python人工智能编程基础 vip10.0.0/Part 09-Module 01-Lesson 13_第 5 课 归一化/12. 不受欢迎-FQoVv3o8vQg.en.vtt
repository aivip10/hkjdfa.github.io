&gt;&gt; Katie, I'm so unpopular. &gt;&gt; Don't worry, I am too. I only have 63 Facebook

00:00:05.237 --> 00:00:10.575
friends. &gt;&gt; Yeah, well I only have 54 Twitter followers. &gt;&gt; Well, the average

00:00:10.575 --> 00:00:14.924
number of Facebook friends is 190, so I have 127 friends less than average.

00:00:14.924 --> 00:00:20.336
That's a lot. &gt;&gt; Well, the average number of Twitter followers is 208. &gt;&gt; So I

00:00:20.336 --> 00:00:25.705
have 154 fewer Twitter followers. &gt;&gt; Ok. Well, let's look at the ratios. I have

00:00:25.705 --> 00:00:30.971
33% of the average number of Facebook friends. &gt;&gt; Yeah, but even looking at it

00:00:30.971 --> 00:00:35.885
that way, I still only have 25% of the average number of Twitter followers. I am

00:00:35.885 --> 00:00:40.815
totally unpopular. &gt;&gt; I know what to do. Let's ask Chris. He has way more

00:00:40.815 --> 00:00:45.459
Facebook friends than average. Well, a better way to look at popularity, would

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:49.349
be to look at the distributions. The distribution of facebook friends and

00:00:49.349 --> 00:00:53.632
Twitter followers are normal. The standard deviation of Twitter followers is 60,

00:00:53.632 --> 00:00:57.536
but the standard deviation of Facebook friends is only 35. So, the number of

00:00:57.536 --> 00:01:01.253
standard deviations away from the mean is definitely a better way to look at

00:01:01.253 --> 00:01:02.100
unpopularity.
