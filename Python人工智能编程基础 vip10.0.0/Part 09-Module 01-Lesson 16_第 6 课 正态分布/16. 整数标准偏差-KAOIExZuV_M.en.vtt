00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.196
So now we have that our population parameters are about 13 for the mean and 4.8

00:00:05.196 --> 00:00:10.708
for the standard deviation. And remember the units are average karma points per

00:00:10.708 --> 00:00:15.932
post. Using these rounded values, let's draw our distribution. We're going to

00:00:15.932 --> 00:00:21.321
say that it's normal so here's our theoretical probability density function. And

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:26.879
here where the mean, equals the median, equals the mode, we have 13. Let's say

00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:32.261
here's one standard deviation above the mean, and here's standard deviation less

00:00:32.261 --> 00:00:37.560
than the mean. And here's two standard deviations. If our standard deviation is

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.726
4.8, then what should our values be here, here, here, and here?
