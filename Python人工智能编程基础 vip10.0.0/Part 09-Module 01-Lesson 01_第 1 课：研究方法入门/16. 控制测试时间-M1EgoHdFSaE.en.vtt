00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.955
Yes, we would trust the results more because we're holding one of these factors

00:00:04.968 --> 00:00:09.955
constant. When more factors are held constant, the test is more reliable because

00:00:09.967 --> 00:00:14.682
these conditions are the same for all people that took the test. We always have

00:00:14.693 --> 00:00:19.452
to think about extraneous factors, things that can impact the outcome that we

00:00:19.464 --> 00:00:24.537
may not have thought about. These extraneous factors can impact the outcome, in

00:00:24.549 --> 00:00:29.264
this case, our memory. These extraneous factors are often called lurking

00:00:29.276 --> 00:00:34.229
variables. They just lurk around waiting to ambush your results. It's really

00:00:34.241 --> 00:00:39.453
difficult to account for every possible extraneous factor. But this is something

00:00:39.465 --> 00:00:44.138
to be aware of, not only as you're going through this course, but when you

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.205
analyze data in your daily lives.
