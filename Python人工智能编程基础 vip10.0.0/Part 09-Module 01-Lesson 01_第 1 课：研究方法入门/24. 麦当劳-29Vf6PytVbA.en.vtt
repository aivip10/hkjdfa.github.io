00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.180
&gt;&gt; Did you know that no two countries with a McDonald's, they've never gone to

00:00:04.192 --> 00:00:06.793
war with each other? Did you know that? &gt;&gt; No.

00:00:06.793 --> 00:00:11.784
&gt;&gt; No, I didn't know that. , &gt;&gt; Yeah, because everyone's way too lazy after they

00:00:11.796 --> 00:00:16.043
get fat. &gt;&gt; China and the US haven't gone to war because there's a McDonald's in

00:00:16.055 --> 00:00:20.358
China and then there's a McDonald's here. &gt;&gt; Really? No I didn't know that. &gt;&gt;

00:00:20.358 --> 00:00:21.744
Two countries?

00:00:21.744 --> 00:00:26.638
&gt;&gt; Yeah, did you know? &gt;&gt; No, I didn't know that. &gt;&gt; Wouldn't surprise me. &gt;&gt; Is

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.636
that really true? &gt;&gt; It's true.

00:00:28.636 --> 00:00:32.415
&gt;&gt; Nobody had heard of the golden arches theory of conflict prevention before,

00:00:32.427 --> 00:00:36.130
but I put them on the spot and asked them for a possible explanation. Why do you

00:00:36.142 --> 00:00:40.482
think that is? &gt;&gt; Because that good food, tastes good. &gt;&gt; Globalization of the

00:00:40.494 --> 00:00:44.427
economy. &gt;&gt; Once you have a McDonald's in your country, your motivation just

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:49.247
goes way down. &gt;&gt; To have a McDonald's you've reached a certain status, I guess.

00:00:49.342 --> 00:00:52.670
, And that makes you more first world. I don't know.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.741
&gt;&gt; Maybe countries that bring in McDonald's accept Americans a little more

00:00:56.753 --> 00:00:58.551
freely. &gt;&gt; I don't know.

00:00:58.551 --> 00:01:02.494
&gt;&gt; This correlation between McDonald's and peace can only lead to some

00:01:02.506 --> 00:01:07.103
interesting policy conclusions. So I asked another question. &gt;&gt; So do you think

00:01:07.115 --> 00:01:13.156
that if every country in the world had a McDonald's, there'd be world peace? &gt;&gt;

00:01:13.156 --> 00:01:14.896
Absolutely not.

00:01:14.896 --> 00:01:20.313
&gt;&gt; I don't think so because there's different, different, different ways that

00:01:20.325 --> 00:01:25.968
everybody think. I wish everybody agreed to do it, but I don't think so. &gt;&gt; I'm

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:31.671
skeptical that it's true, actually. &gt;&gt; It's called the golden arches theory of

00:01:31.683 --> 00:01:34.645
conflict resolution. &gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:34.645 --> 00:01:40.782
&gt;&gt; Correlation does not mean causation, so. &gt;&gt; Words of wisdom. &gt;&gt;, &gt;&gt; That

00:01:40.794 --> 00:01:45.294
would be nice wouldn't it? &gt;&gt; Guess I'd go to McDonald's to get that Big Mac,

00:01:45.966 --> 00:01:49.645
that smile on your face. You don't have to about anything. &gt;&gt; Mcdonald's

00:01:49.657 --> 00:01:54.028
originated here, right? So, I mean , I just don't think it's in their best

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.684
interest to be putting up McDonalds's in places that they're at war with. &gt;&gt; I

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.018
mean, that, the, it stretched too far. There's way to correlate that data. &gt;&gt; I

00:02:02.554 --> 00:02:06.377
think there probably is something more driving the conflict than not having a

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.942
McDonald's.
