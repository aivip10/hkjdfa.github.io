00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.200
As we saw previously,

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.030
when we have two numeric variables,

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.770
at least one of them discrete.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:15.750
Jitter and transparency, can be used to make the trends in the data clearer.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.175
If we want to plot a quantitative variable against a qualitative variable,

00:00:20.175 --> 00:00:21.825
we can take the same approach.

00:00:21.825 --> 00:00:24.525
Just mapping each level of the qualitative variable,

00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:26.280
to an arbitrary number.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:31.245
For example, let's say that we have a number of game scores from three different teams.

00:00:31.245 --> 00:00:33.945
North, Central and South.

00:00:33.945 --> 00:00:37.650
If we associate one with North, two with Central,

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:38.985
and three with South,

00:00:38.985 --> 00:00:42.405
then we could use a jittered scatter plot with team on the x -axis,

00:00:42.405 --> 00:00:44.890
and score on the y-axis.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.120
A more common visualization for this quantitative versus qualitative comparison,

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.390
is the violin plot.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.365
Instead of plotting data points individually,

00:00:55.365 --> 00:00:58.610
we have a curve for each level of the categorical variable,

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.850
whose area depicts the distribution of points.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.755
Where the curve is wider,

00:01:03.755 --> 00:01:05.620
there are more data points.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.090
It's basically a smooth histogram,

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.910
or a density curve turned on its side.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:16.015
For North, you can see that they scored more points in the 50's, than the 60's.

00:01:16.015 --> 00:01:21.965
You can also see that Central tends to score more points than either North or South.

00:01:21.965 --> 00:01:24.635
Compared to the jittered scatter plot,

00:01:24.635 --> 00:01:29.170
having the distinct curves makes it easier to remember that the variable is categorical,

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.880
and easier to compare their distributions.
