00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.471
Now the next thing we're going to do is calculate this standard deviation. But

00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:09.164
this time, since we're trying to estimate population parameters, you're going to

00:00:09.164 --> 00:00:13.609
use the formula for the sample standard deviation. Remember that this is just

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:18.078
like the population standard deviation except we divide by n minus 1. This is

00:00:18.078 --> 00:00:22.566
Bessel's correction to make the standard deviation a little bit bigger, since the

00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:27.119
standard deviation of the sample tends to underestimate the variability. So go

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.465
ahead and try and calculate the sample standard deviation. And this will be a

00:00:31.465 --> 00:00:32.659
good review for you.
