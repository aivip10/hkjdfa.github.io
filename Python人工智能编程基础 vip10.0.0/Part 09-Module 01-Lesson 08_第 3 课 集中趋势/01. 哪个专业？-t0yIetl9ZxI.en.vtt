00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.532
&gt;&gt; Judging by these distributions, it looks like most Nursing majors make

00:00:05.532 --> 00:00:11.553
somewhere in between 50,000 and 60,000 a year. So, if you said anything between

00:00:11.553 --> 00:00:17.116
these two numbers, then you got it right. But for most Geography majors, it

00:00:17.116 --> 00:00:22.881
looks like anything between 40,000 and maybe 55,000. So here, we're focusing on

00:00:22.881 --> 00:00:27.911
the center of the distribution, where most of the scores lie. And this center is

00:00:27.911 --> 00:00:32.957
a little fatter. You can use distributions like this to guess how much you might

00:00:32.957 --> 00:00:36.313
make if you were a Nursing major or Geography major.
