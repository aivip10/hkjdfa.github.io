00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.588
A researcher found a relationship between the number of hours spent playing

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.201
violent video games per week and the level of aggression shown by adolescent

00:00:09.213 --> 00:00:13.345
males. This is measured by the aggression scale, which is someone's

00:00:13.357 --> 00:00:17.749
self-reported measure of aggressive behavior. More hours spent playing

00:00:17.761 --> 00:00:23.305
corresponded with a higher aggression score. Given this information, what can we

00:00:23.317 --> 00:00:24.127
say is true?
