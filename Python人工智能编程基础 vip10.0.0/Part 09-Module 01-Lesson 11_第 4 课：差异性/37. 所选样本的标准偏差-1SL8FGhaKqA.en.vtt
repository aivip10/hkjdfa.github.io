00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.225
&gt;&gt; First you need to take the average of these, which is 19.4. Remember that the

00:00:05.225 --> 00:00:10.418
sample average is denoted by x bar. Let's round to two decimal places. Now we

00:00:10.418 --> 00:00:16.068
subtract the mean from each value in our data. Then we square this deviation and

00:00:16.068 --> 00:00:21.614
then add them up. This sum of squares is 54.22. After that, we divide by the

00:00:21.614 --> 00:00:27.303
sample size, which is 9, and then we take the square root. We get then that the

00:00:27.303 --> 00:00:33.262
standard deviation of this sample is 2.45. Whoa, that's a lot smaller than what

00:00:33.262 --> 00:00:37.855
we got for the population standard deviation, which is 5.99.
