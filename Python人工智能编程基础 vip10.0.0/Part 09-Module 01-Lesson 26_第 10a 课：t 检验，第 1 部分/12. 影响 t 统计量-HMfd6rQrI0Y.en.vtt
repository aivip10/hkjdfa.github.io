00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.323
If x-bar increases, then the difference between x-bar and mu 0 becomes larger.

00:00:05.323 --> 00:00:10.106
And therefore the t statistic becomes larger. That means the t statistic will

00:00:10.106 --> 00:00:15.280
be out here more, to the right. And then that's evidence that the mean of the

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.985
population that x bar comes from is greater than this mean. If x bar decreases

00:00:20.985 --> 00:00:25.340
goes the opposite way, then the distance between these will also increase but

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.984
in the opposite direction. x bar will then be less than this value whatever it

00:00:30.984 --> 00:00:36.203
is. That means the t statistic will be way out here in the left. And then

00:00:36.203 --> 00:00:41.571
that's evidence that mu is less than mu 0. And finally the further the value of

00:00:41.571 --> 00:00:48.690
x bar from mu 0 in either direction. The stronger the evidence that they're not

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.254
the same. So when we're comparing x bar to mu 0, we center the t distribution

00:00:53.254 --> 00:00:59.690
at mu 0. And then we find where x bar lies on this distribution. The further

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.899
out x bar is, the more likely that it comes from a population that has a mean

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.573
significantly different than mu 0.
