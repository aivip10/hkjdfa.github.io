00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.060
&gt;&gt; This first option, mean of squared deviations. Each of these is a squared

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.004
deviation. And then we took the mean, which is adding them all up and then

00:00:10.004 --> 00:00:15.440
dividing by 10. So this is a way to put it in words. Sum of squared deviations

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.869
means we, sum up all these, and then we divide by N, which is exactly what we

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.193
did. The mean squared deviation squared, would be finding the mean of this,

00:00:26.193 --> 00:00:31.875
which is the variance, but then squaring this number. So this one doesn't work.
