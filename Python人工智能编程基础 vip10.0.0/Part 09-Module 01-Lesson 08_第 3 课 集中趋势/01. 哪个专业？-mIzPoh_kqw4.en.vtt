00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.170
&gt;&gt; Let's say you're a college freshman and you're choosing a major. You're

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.675
debating between Nursing and Geography. So, you decide that you're going to look

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:13.182
at how much Nursing majors make as opposed to Geography majors. Fortunately,

00:00:13.182 --> 00:00:17.600
these days, data is often easily accessible. You find that the frequency

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.913
distributions of Nursing majors' salaries and Geography majors' salaries looks

00:00:22.913 --> 00:00:27.627
like this. So, let's say that these histograms were created from the data from

00:00:27.627 --> 00:00:32.384
everyone who either majored in Nursing or Geography, and the x-axis represents

00:00:32.384 --> 00:00:37.526
their annual income in thousands. From these distributions, approximately what

00:00:37.526 --> 00:00:42.176
income do most Nursing majors make, and approximately what income do most

00:00:42.176 --> 00:00:43.790
Geography majors make?
