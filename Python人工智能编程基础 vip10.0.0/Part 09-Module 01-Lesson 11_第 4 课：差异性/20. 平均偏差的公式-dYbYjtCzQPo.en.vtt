00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.892
&gt;&gt; Well this one would just be one value, where we take one of the data values,

00:00:04.892 --> 00:00:09.870
subtract the mean, and divide by 10. But we used all of these values, so it

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.245
can't be this one. This one doesn't really make sense, we wouldn't add the mean

00:00:15.245 --> 00:00:20.414
to one of the values and then divide it by 10. This one makes a little more

00:00:20.414 --> 00:00:25.790
sense because we have this summation sign, sigma sum, but we're not adding up

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:30.559
the Xi's and dividing by 10. That is the mean, but we are adding up the

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:36.040
deviations from the mean, which are each of these, and then dividing by 10. So

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.369
this is the formula that describes what we just did. Good job.
