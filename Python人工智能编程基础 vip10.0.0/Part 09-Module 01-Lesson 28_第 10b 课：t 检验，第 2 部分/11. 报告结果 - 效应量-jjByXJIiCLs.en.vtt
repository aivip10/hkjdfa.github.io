00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.774
Finally, we wanted to present our effect size measures. And again, this could

00:00:03.774 --> 00:00:09.156
be Cohen's d, r squared or others or both. In terms of APA style, simply write

00:00:09.156 --> 00:00:14.532
d equals values rounded to 2 decimals or r squared equals, decimal place, and

00:00:14.532 --> 00:00:21.318
the values rounded to two decimals. One thing to notice, is in APA style, we

00:00:21.318 --> 00:00:26.655
don't use a leading zero for situations in which we have proportions. If the

00:00:26.655 --> 00:00:31.570
value cannot be greater than 1, we don't need a zero in this spot right here.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.422
So for r squared, because it's a proportion, we cannot have a value greater

00:00:34.422 --> 00:00:39.434
than one. So we'd write it just like this. So for example if r squared were

00:00:39.434 --> 00:00:46.160
0.17, you would just write it 0.17 with no zero here. Cohen's d can be greater

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:54.083
than one. So if we had a Cohen's d of let's say, 0.25, we would write d equals

00:00:54.083 --> 00:00:56.859
0.25.
