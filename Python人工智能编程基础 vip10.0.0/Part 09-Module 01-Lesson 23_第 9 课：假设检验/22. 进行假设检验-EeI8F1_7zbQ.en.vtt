00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.705
If we reject the null, that means we're accepting the alternative hypothesis,

00:00:04.705 --> 00:00:09.826
which is that there is a significant difference. That means the sample

00:00:09.826 --> 00:00:13.794
statistic we get is very different than what we would expect for all the other

00:00:13.794 --> 00:00:19.528
samples we could have gotten from that population. That means our sample mean

00:00:19.528 --> 00:00:24.285
will fall within the critical region. If we just look at the positive

00:00:24.285 --> 00:00:28.758
z-critical values, then our z-score should be greater than the z-critical

00:00:28.758 --> 00:00:33.998
value. This means that the sample mean will lie in the critical region. And

00:00:33.998 --> 00:00:38.534
finally, the probability of obtaining the sample mean will be less than the

00:00:38.534 --> 00:00:44.200
alpha level. We set this alpha level as a guideline for the probability of

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.280
getting that sample statistic. And if the probability of getting that sample

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.506
statistic is low, that means there's something going on. And we have evidence

00:00:53.506 --> 00:00:55.930
to reject the null.
