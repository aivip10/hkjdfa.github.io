Clearly, there isn't just one way to measure things like memory, happiness,

00:00:04.867 --> 00:00:09.920
guilt, love, and these are called constructs. It's very difficult sometimes to

00:00:09.932 --> 00:00:14.850
define and measure them, and so there are a lot of different ways that we can do

00:00:14.862 --> 00:00:19.545
that. BBC came up with one way of measuring memory by creating a test on how

00:00:19.557 --> 00:00:25.078
well you can remember faces. Click the link at the right, called BBC Face Memory

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.809
Test, to do this memory test. Remember, your scores and write them down. And

00:00:29.821 --> 00:00:34.778
again, this isn't graded. We're just going to do this because this is a formal

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.058
way of measuring and testing memory.
