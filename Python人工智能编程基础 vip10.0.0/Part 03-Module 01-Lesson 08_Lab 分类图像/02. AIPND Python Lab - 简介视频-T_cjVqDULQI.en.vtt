Hi students, Jennifer here.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.300
I'm going to guide you through the classifying images lab.

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.939
Let's click on over to start the lab.

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:17.710
Your city is hosting a citywide dog show and you

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.060
volunteered to help the organizing committee with contestant registration.

00:00:22.059 --> 00:00:25.149
The problem is to host this dog show,

00:00:25.149 --> 00:00:28.659
they had to cancel and reschedule an annual arts festival.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.760
Some tricksters we're upset about

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.230
this cancellation and they decide to submit some fake registrations.

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:40.224
These fake registrations will be of animals that aren't dogs.

00:00:40.225 --> 00:00:44.304
You decide you can speed up registration by computationally

00:00:44.304 --> 00:00:49.454
determining if registered images are of dogs or other animals.

00:00:49.454 --> 00:00:52.219
Once you've finished reading over the lab description,

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.600
click on over and start with the lab instructions.
