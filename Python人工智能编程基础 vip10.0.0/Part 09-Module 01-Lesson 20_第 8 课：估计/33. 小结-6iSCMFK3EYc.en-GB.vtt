00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.303
In this lesson, you learned about estimating population parameters with

00:00:04.303 --> 00:00:08.857
confidence intervals and then analyzing whether or not a search and treatment

00:00:08.857 --> 00:00:13.125
may have had an effect. So the examples we've used so far are the Bieber

00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:17.923
tweeter, we wanted to see it's influence on klout scores. And then the other

00:00:17.923 --> 00:00:22.620
treatment was the song about hypothesis testing for lesson nine, which I

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.090
seriously might do. After all this talk about it, I'm really curious about

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.768
whether or not this will work. I guess we'll just have to wait and see the

00:00:30.768 --> 00:00:35.180
results of the poll where you rated your engagement and learning. Speaking of

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.045
which, that's the dependent variable. In the next lesson you'll learn how to

00:00:40.045 --> 00:00:44.620
formalize the procedure of deciding whether or not the sample receiving

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.653
treatment had likely or unlikely statistics.
