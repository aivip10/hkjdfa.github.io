00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.107
&gt;&gt; So if the mean, median and mode are the same for both of these distributions,

00:00:04.107 --> 00:00:08.358
what's the difference between these two? There might be more than one answer.

00:00:08.358 --> 00:00:12.627
Are the salaries of people with social networking accounts more consistent? Or

00:00:12.627 --> 00:00:16.625
maybe the salaries of the general public are more consistent. Or is it that

00:00:16.625 --> 00:00:21.160
people with the highest salaries don't have social networking accounts? People

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.483
with the lowest salaries have social networking accounts? Or finally, the

00:00:25.483 --> 00:00:30.131
distribution of salaries of the general public sample is more spread out. Check

00:00:30.131 --> 00:00:33.146
all that you think we can say about these distributions.
