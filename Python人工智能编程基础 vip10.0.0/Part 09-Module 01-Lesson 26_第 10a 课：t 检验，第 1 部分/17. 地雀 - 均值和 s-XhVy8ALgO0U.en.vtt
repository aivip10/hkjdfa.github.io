00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.406
Let's do this in the spread sheet. Remember that there are 500 values. So, here

00:00:06.406 --> 00:00:13.825
anywhere in the blank white cells, we'll write equals average A2:A501. We get

00:00:13.825 --> 00:00:23.353
that the average is about 6.47. And here we'll calculate each of the squared

00:00:23.353 --> 00:00:27.959
deviations equals A2 minus D2 squared.

00:00:27.959 --> 00:00:28.893
[SOUND].

00:00:28.893 --> 00:00:38.815
Copy that. Paste it in column B. We'll take the sum of squared deviations. And

00:00:38.815 --> 00:00:45.144
then we'll divide that by n minus 1. That gives us the variance. And then we'll

00:00:45.144 --> 00:00:51.644
take the square root. And then we get our sample SD is about 0.4.
