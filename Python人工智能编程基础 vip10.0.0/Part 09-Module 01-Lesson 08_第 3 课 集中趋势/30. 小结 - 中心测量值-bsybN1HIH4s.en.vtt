00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.748
&gt;&gt; So now, you've learned about three measures of center, the mean, median, and

00:00:04.748 --> 00:00:09.800
mode. Now, for your final quiz, we're going to solidify the ideas that we talked

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.887
about in this lesson with the pros and cons of each. Which of these have simple

00:00:14.887 --> 00:00:20.217
equations or will always change if any data value changes? Which of these are

00:00:20.217 --> 00:00:25.352
not affected by change in bin size? Which of these are not affected severely by

00:00:25.352 --> 00:00:30.635
outliers? And finally, which of these is easy to find on a histogram? Remember,

00:00:30.635 --> 00:00:35.856
that bin size refers to when we're creating the histogram of the data. So, check

00:00:35.856 --> 00:00:40.754
which ones apply to each of these measures of center, and that's your final

00:00:40.754 --> 00:00:41.187
quiz.
