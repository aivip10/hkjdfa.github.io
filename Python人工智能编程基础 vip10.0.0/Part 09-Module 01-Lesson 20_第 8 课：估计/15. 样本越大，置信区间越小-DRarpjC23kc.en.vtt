00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:06.495
So now, we have this confidence interval and that ranges from about 38 to 42.

00:00:06.495 --> 00:00:12.260
So, it's a lot smaller than the one we had calculated when we were basing it off

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.240
of a sample of size 35. Bigger samples give us more precise estimates by giving

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.070
us smaller intervals because they shrink the standard deviation of this sampling

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:28.535
distribution. So, they shrink the interval in which a sample mean might feasibly

00:00:28.535 --> 00:00:34.050
lie. Now, notice that this confidence interval doesn't even contain the original

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.311
population mean 37.72. Therefore, it's very unlikely that a random sample of

00:00:40.311 --> 00:00:46.886
size 250 with a mean of 40 could have been selected by chance. This is evidence

00:00:46.886 --> 00:00:52.204
for treatment effect. So, with a bigger sample size, we have a smaller interval

00:00:52.204 --> 00:00:57.573
for which we're pretty sure the true population lies. So, with a 95% confidence

00:00:57.573 --> 00:01:04.159
interval with the sample sizes being 35, we had a pretty big interval. But with

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:10.270
a 95% confidence interval with sample sizes being 250, we had a much smaller

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.272
confidence interval. The greater our sample size, the smaller our confidence

00:01:15.272 --> 00:01:20.064
interval for the true population perameter after the intervention. And the

00:01:20.064 --> 00:01:23.953
better we are able to estimate our population parameters.
