00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.224
This is the Python lab instructions video.

00:00:04.224 --> 00:00:05.934
When you're building a house,

00:00:05.934 --> 00:00:07.949
there's a blueprint of the house made first,

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.324
to outline construction prior to beginning building the house.

00:00:11.324 --> 00:00:14.209
When writing a complex program for work or for fun,

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.260
you too will want a blueprint that outlines

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.960
the tasks you need to complete with your program.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.300
One way to create a blueprint is to write

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.810
an outline of the task you'll need to complete with your program.

00:00:24.809 --> 00:00:30.034
Next, you'll use this outline to draft the program with comments, and functions stubs.

00:00:30.035 --> 00:00:33.009
Where a functions stub contains the function name,

00:00:33.009 --> 00:00:34.872
definition in doc string,

00:00:34.872 --> 00:00:38.565
but the task the function performs have been left undefined.

00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:41.960
With this lab will provide you with both the program outline,

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.094
and the blueprint to help you complete the lab more quickly.

00:00:45.094 --> 00:00:47.530
Additionally, these materials provide an example

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.590
of both to help you with your future programs.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.438
In the lab instructions,

00:00:52.438 --> 00:00:54.535
you'll find the program outline,

00:00:54.534 --> 00:00:57.234
and check images program itself,

00:00:57.234 --> 00:00:59.394
is the blueprint for the actual program.

00:00:59.395 --> 00:01:02.370
To complete this lab, you'll edit check images,

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:03.729
defining all the functions,

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:06.429
such that the final program will achieve

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.360
the four objectives outlined in the lab instructions.

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:14.644
You'll be editing check images in the lab workspace.

00:01:14.644 --> 00:01:18.484
All changes you make to check images in the workspace will always be saved,

00:01:18.484 --> 00:01:21.905
even when you log out after making the change.

00:01:21.905 --> 00:01:25.737
You may want to have one browser window open to the lesson,

00:01:25.737 --> 00:01:29.689
and another browser window open to the lab workspace to make it

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:34.129
easier to switch between the lab workspace, and the lessons.

00:01:34.129 --> 00:01:36.629
Once you've finished reading over the lab instructions,

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:40.469
click on over to the workspace 'How to' to learn how to use the lab workspace.
