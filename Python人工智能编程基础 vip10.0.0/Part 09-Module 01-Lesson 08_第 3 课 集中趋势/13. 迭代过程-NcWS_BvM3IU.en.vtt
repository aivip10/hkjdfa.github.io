00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.692
have 5 here. This could be any number, and if we had 1,000 values, we most

00:00:10.692 --> 00:00:16.489
certainly would not want to write them all out. Instead, we can just call it the

00:00:16.489 --> 00:00:22.297
sum of all the salaries, divided by the number of Geography majors that exist in

00:00:22.297 --> 00:00:25.879
the dataset. So, this will work for any dataset.
