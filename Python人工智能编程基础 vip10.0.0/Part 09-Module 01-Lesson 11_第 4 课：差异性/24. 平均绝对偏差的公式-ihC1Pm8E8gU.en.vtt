00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.632
This one means that we're first summing up all the values, and then we're taking

00:00:04.632 --> 00:00:09.197
the absolute value. Since these are all positive, taking the absolute value

00:00:09.197 --> 00:00:13.782
won't do anything. It'll already be positive, but this says nothing about the

00:00:13.782 --> 00:00:18.511
deviations. In fact, this will just be the mean again. This one says that you're

00:00:18.511 --> 00:00:24.048
finding the absolute deviation. So you're taking a value minus the mean, which

00:00:24.048 --> 00:00:29.911
are these deviations. But then taking the absolute value of them, here, adding

00:00:29.911 --> 00:00:35.756
them all up, with this sigma, and then dividing by n, the total number. Which in

00:00:35.756 --> 00:00:41.125
this case is 10. So this one does describe what you did. This one says that

00:00:41.125 --> 00:00:47.220
you're finding each deviation, which are here. You're taking the absolute value,

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.751
which are here. You're dividing each of these by n, which in this case is ten.

00:00:52.751 --> 00:00:58.358
And then you're adding all of them up, which will give you the same thing as if

00:00:58.358 --> 00:01:03.510
you first added all of these up, and then divided by 10. So this one also

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.917
describes what you did. This one, looks like it's going the opposite direction,

00:01:08.917 --> 00:01:14.196
so instead we're taking the mean and then subtracting each of these values. So

00:01:14.196 --> 00:01:19.431
we would get the opposite of each of these. We would get positive 19,574. This

00:01:19.431 --> 00:01:24.613
would also be positive, but these would be negative. But then it says we take

00:01:24.613 --> 00:01:29.804
the absolute value, which will lead us right back to this column here. Because

00:01:29.804 --> 00:01:34.957
it doesn't matter if these are negative or positive. Then we divide by n, and we

00:01:34.957 --> 00:01:40.105
get the same thing as this. This one says that we're just using one data value.

00:01:40.105 --> 00:01:44.986
We don't know which one it is, so tracking the mean, taking the absolute value,

00:01:44.986 --> 00:01:49.359
and then dividing by n, which doesn't give us what we want. This was very

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:53.775
tricky, but the more you work with formulas, the more comfortable you'll get

00:01:53.775 --> 00:01:58.143
with them. And don't worry, by the end of this course, you're really going to

00:01:58.143 --> 00:02:02.780
understand all of these symbols and formulas that we're using. And it'll really

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.259
help you in expressing mathematical ideas.
