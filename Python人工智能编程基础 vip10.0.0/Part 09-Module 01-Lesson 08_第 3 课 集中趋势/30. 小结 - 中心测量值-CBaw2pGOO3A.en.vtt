00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.578
&gt;&gt; So, the mean does have a simple equation. And if you remember, it's the sum

00:00:05.578 --> 00:00:10.731
of x divided by n. The mean will also always change if any data value changes.

00:00:10.731 --> 00:00:16.059
Median will sometimes change, and mode will also sometimes change. The mean is

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:21.205
not affected by change bin size, it will always be the same, no matter how we

00:00:21.205 --> 00:00:26.561
visualize the data with a histogram, and the same with the median. But you've

00:00:26.561 --> 00:00:31.664
seen that the mode does change, it becomes a new interval if we change the bin

00:00:31.664 --> 00:00:36.425
size. You saw in the case of the Michael Jordan example that the mean is

00:00:36.425 --> 00:00:41.852
affected by outliers, but the median not as much, so not severely affected, same

00:00:41.852 --> 00:00:46.650
with the mode. And finally, it is kind of hard to find the mean and median on

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.962
the histogram. But you always know which one the mode is, because it's the

00:00:50.962 --> 00:00:52.215
highest frequency.
