00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:07.201
&gt;&gt; Let's go through each one of these. With this first one, we take the square

00:00:07.201 --> 00:00:14.755
root of the average square deviation. Well, the deviation is x i minus x bar.

00:00:14.755 --> 00:00:21.271
The square deviation is then just x i minus x bar squared, and the average is

00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:27.392
summing each squared deviation up and then dividing by n. And this is our

00:00:27.392 --> 00:00:33.197
formula for standard deviation. The average square deviation is basically this

00:00:33.197 --> 00:00:38.467
inside the square root sign, but then instead of taking the square root, we

00:00:38.467 --> 00:00:44.222
square it. This is not the standard deviation. The sum of square deviations,

00:00:44.222 --> 00:00:50.039
well these are the square deviations so the sum is just this. Remember that this

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.913
is also called sum of squares. Sum of absolute deviations squared, the absolute

00:00:55.913 --> 00:01:01.220
deviation is xi minus x bar with the absolute values, and if we square them

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.781
that's the same as if we didn't take the absolute value. And then if we take the

00:01:06.781 --> 00:01:11.773
sum, we get the sum of squares again, so these two are equivalent, and they're

00:01:11.773 --> 00:01:16.699
not the standard deviation. Finally, we have the sum of squared deviations,

00:01:16.699 --> 00:01:21.418
divided by n, and then the square root of that. So that is also our formula for

00:01:21.418 --> 00:01:25.113
standard deviation. Good job. I know this was really hard.
