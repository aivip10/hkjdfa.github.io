00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.548
Whenever we conduct a research study and compute statistical results, we report

00:00:03.548 --> 00:00:07.820
those results in something called a Results Section. So, I'm going to outline a

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.379
little bit what goes into result sections. The first thing we put in our result

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:14.439
sections are descriptive statistics, for example the mean in standard

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:18.726
deviation. The descriptive statistics represent the heart of our study, this

00:00:18.726 --> 00:00:23.183
tells us exactly what happened in out study and should always be reported. And

00:00:23.183 --> 00:00:27.477
we can report those in three ways. We can report them in text. In other words,

00:00:27.477 --> 00:00:31.474
we put them right in, in between our words in our results section. We can put

00:00:31.474 --> 00:00:36.200
them in graphs, such as a bar graph. Or we can put them in tables. Next, we'll

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.673
want to report our inferential statistics. And this is either a hypothesis

00:00:39.673 --> 00:00:44.220
test, or a confidence interval, or sometimes both. So when reporting a

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.785
hypothesis test, you want to give the reader the following pieces of

00:00:46.785 --> 00:00:50.710
information. You want to tell the reader, what kind of test did you conduct?

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.608
For example, a one sample t test. Next, you want to give the actual value of

00:00:55.608 --> 00:00:59.415
the test statistic. For example, the value of t. Then, you provide the degrees

00:00:59.415 --> 00:01:02.423
of freedom of the test, not the formula, but the actual number that comes from

00:01:02.423 --> 00:01:06.996
the formula. You also want to give the reader the p-value, specifically the

00:01:06.996 --> 00:01:11.171
exact p-value, if possible. Next, if applicable, give the direction of the

00:01:11.171 --> 00:01:16.030
test. For example, is it a one tail test, or a two tail test? And always

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.002
provide the alpha level. Always let the reader know what alpha level you used,

00:01:20.002 --> 00:01:24.453
to make your decision. For many disciplines, we use APA style to report the

00:01:24.453 --> 00:01:30.138
results of our hypothesis test. APA stands for American Psychological

00:01:30.138 --> 00:01:34.875
Association. The APA has a whole guide on writing research papers and one of

00:01:34.875 --> 00:01:40.940
the parts of that guide, tells us how to write inferential statistical results.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.216
I'm going to give you a brief introduction to APA style for statistics, as it

00:01:44.216 --> 00:01:49.831
relates to the T-test. So, here's a generic outline of how to present the

00:01:49.831 --> 00:01:54.496
results of a t test in APA style. First, we put the test statistic name, in

00:01:54.496 --> 00:01:59.650
this case it's t. Next to that, we put the degrees of freedom in parentheses.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.013
We put an equal sign, then we provide the t value, rounded to two decimal

00:02:03.013 --> 00:02:07.931
places with a comma, then we give the p value. Again, rounded to two decimal

00:02:07.931 --> 00:02:11.660
places. There are some exceptions in this rule, but for the most part, this is

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.820
how you do it. And then, we put out the comma and we tell the direction of the

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.218
test whether it's one tailed or two tailed. I'll give you a more concrete

00:02:19.218 --> 00:02:23.875
example in a little bit. Imagine the situation in which we have a t value with

00:02:23.875 --> 00:02:28.928
24 degrees of freedom equals negative 2.50. If we're doing it by hand we only

00:02:28.928 --> 00:02:32.408
know whether the p value is less than or greater than 0.05, and we have one

00:02:32.408 --> 00:02:37.685
tailed test. This is how you'd write it out. If we used a computer to get these

00:02:37.685 --> 00:02:43.426
results, we'd end up with an exact p-value. An exact one tailed p-value for

00:02:43.426 --> 00:02:49.715
this situation rounded to two decimal places is 0.01. So, in that case, we can

00:02:49.715 --> 00:02:51.243
actually put p equals 0.01.
