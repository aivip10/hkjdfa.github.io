00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.036
Gallons of gasoline is not a construct, because we already have a way of

00:00:05.048 --> 00:00:10.388
measuring it in gallons. Intelligence is a construct. How do we measure and

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.135
define intelligence? We have the IQ test, or maybe we could measure intelligence

00:00:16.146 --> 00:00:21.645
with grades. But grades may also help us measure something like how hard we're

00:00:21.657 --> 00:00:27.987
working. Like effort. Effort is a construct. We might measure effort by how many

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:33.516
minutes we spend working on homework or by grades, or GPA. Age is also a

00:00:33.528 --> 00:00:39.535
construct. If I had put age in years, I would have defined age as the number of

00:00:39.547 --> 00:00:45.366
years you've been living but some people might look at age as how mature you

00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:46.258
are.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.907
Here I didn't put a way of measuring it, and age therefore is kind of tricky,

00:00:51.017 --> 00:00:56.029
would be considered a construct in this case. So maturity, age in years, and

00:00:56.041 --> 00:01:01.124
wisdom are all three different ways you could possibly measure age. Hunger is

00:01:01.136 --> 00:01:06.515
also a construct. Hunger could be measured by how often your tummy grumbles or

00:01:06.527 --> 00:01:12.790
by how deficient in nutrients your body is. Annual salary in US dollars, is not

00:01:12.802 --> 00:01:19.090
a construct. That's because we put in US dollars. And therefore we have a way of

00:01:19.102 --> 00:01:25.338
measuring your annual salary. And finally itchiness is a construct. How would

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.160
you define and measure itchiness? I'll let you ponder that one yourself. We have

00:01:30.172 --> 00:01:34.973
to think carefully about how to define and measure constructs. The descriptions

00:01:34.985 --> 00:01:39.688
for constructs that we settle on, and that allow us to measure them, are called

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.347
our operational definition.
