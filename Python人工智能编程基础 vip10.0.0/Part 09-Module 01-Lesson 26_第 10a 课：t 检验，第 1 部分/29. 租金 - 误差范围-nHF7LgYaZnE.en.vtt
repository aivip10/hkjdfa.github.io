00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.230
Recall that we subtracted the number of standard errors away from the mean, and

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:11.390
that was the margin of error. Therefore, this is the correct answer choice,

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:17.443
where t is the number of standard errors, negative 2.064. And s divided by root

00:00:17.443 --> 00:00:19.553
n is the standard error.
