00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.861
So, let's again look at how we solved for the last confidence interval. We still

00:00:04.861 --> 00:00:10.938
know that the true population mean, Mu sub BT, is going to be within 1.96

00:00:10.938 --> 00:00:18.192
standard deviations of our sample mean. So, our sample mean is 40. And if we

00:00:18.192 --> 00:00:26.528
subtract 1.96 standard deviations, we subtract 1.96 times 1.01. So this is

00:00:26.528 --> 00:00:33.039
38.02, approximately. And then, to find the upper bound of this confidence

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:39.438
interval, we just add 1.96 standard deviations from the mean. So, this is about

00:00:39.438 --> 00:00:45.570
41.98. It's pretty simple when we lay it out like this, just generically x bar

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.970
plus or minus the z score, in this case 1.96 since we want a 95% confidence

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.780
interval, times the standard deviation. But, really understanding the concept of

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.427
the confidence interval is really complicated. So, if you need to, keep

00:01:01.427 --> 00:01:06.305
replaying these videos. Keep thinking about it. Don't worry. It took me a really

00:01:06.305 --> 00:01:11.582
long time. I'm still completely understanding this stuff. It's complicated and

00:01:11.582 --> 00:01:14.673
it requires some thought and patience.
