00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.312
&gt;&gt; This first option is simply adding up each of these salaries, and that's it.

00:00:04.312 --> 00:00:08.862
So, this doesn't accurately describe the procedure for finding the average. This

00:00:08.862 --> 00:00:13.278
one, however, is adding them all up, and then dividing by 5, which is the total

00:00:13.278 --> 00:00:17.640
number of values, which is the definition of the average. This one doesn't

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.682
really make any sense. Summing up all of these and then multiplying by 5. And

00:00:22.682 --> 00:00:27.533
then, this one also says what you did. You took the sum of this salary of

00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:33.011
Geography majors and then you divided by the number of geography majors, which

00:00:33.011 --> 00:00:33.429
was 5.
