00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:06.450
Well, let's multiply both sides of the equation by the standard error. So then

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.000
on this side of the equation, standard error cancels out. And then let's

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.736
multiply both sides of the equation by 1 over root n. So over here, the root n

00:00:17.736 --> 00:00:23.900
divided by root n, cancels out. So on this side, we're left with sigma divided

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.180
by root n, and on this side we're left with SE. So we get that SE is sigma

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:30.633
divided by root n.
