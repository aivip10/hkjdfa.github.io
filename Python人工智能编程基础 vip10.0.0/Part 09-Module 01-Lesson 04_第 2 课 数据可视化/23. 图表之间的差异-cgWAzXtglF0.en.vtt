00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.325
While this one is called a histogram, this one is called a bar graph. The spaces

00:00:05.337 --> 00:00:10.400
in between the columns here mean that each of these is one distinct category.

00:00:10.512 --> 00:00:15.975
Europe is completely distinct from North America, completely distinct from Asia

00:00:15.987 --> 00:00:21.410
and we can't mix them. But with age, we can choose any interval or bin size. And

00:00:21.524 --> 00:00:27.071
so, that's the next really important difference. You can change the bin size for

00:00:27.083 --> 00:00:32.165
age data but not for the country data. We could make our bins from 0 to 80, in

00:00:32.177 --> 00:00:37.614
which case, all the students would be in that one bin. But we can't do the same

00:00:37.626 --> 00:00:43.432
for this unless we make it world, or something different, we could divide it

00:00:43.444 --> 00:00:49.372
into hemispheres but we're still more restricted with this type of data then

00:00:49.384 --> 00:00:54.968
with the age data. And finally, the order of the continents doesn't really

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:01.320
matter. However, age is just in one order, from least to greatest. With the bar

00:01:01.332 --> 00:01:05.870
graph, we might choose to put it into a particular order depending on what

00:01:05.882 --> 00:01:10.890
question we're trying to answer. Such as where are most students from? Then, we

00:01:10.902 --> 00:01:15.620
might put it in a order from least to greatest or greatest to least. Or, we

00:01:15.632 --> 00:01:21.263
might choose to alphabetize it so that viewers can easily find what continent or

00:01:21.275 --> 00:01:26.902
country or whatever they're looking for on the x-axis. And finally, the shape of

00:01:26.914 --> 00:01:32.254
a histogram is very important. Whereas, the shape of a bar graph is arbitrary,

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:37.995
depending on how you choose to order the categories on the x-axis. One thing to

00:01:38.007 --> 00:01:44.219
remember is that with a histogram, the variable on the x-axis is numerical and

00:01:44.231 --> 00:01:50.261
quantitative. Whereas with a bar graph, the variable on the x-axis is often

00:01:50.273 --> 00:01:52.702
categorical or qualitative.
