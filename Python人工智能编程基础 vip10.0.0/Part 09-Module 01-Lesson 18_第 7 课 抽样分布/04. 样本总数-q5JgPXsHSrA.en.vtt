00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.150
So just to remind you, we want to get at least an average of 3 if we're going to

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.105
win in our Vegas gambling game. So let's look at all the possible outcomes we

00:00:10.105 --> 00:00:17.165
could get if we roll the die twice. We could get 1 and then 2, so the mean is

00:00:17.165 --> 00:00:25.886
1.5. Or we could get 1 and 1, so the mean is 1. Or we could get 3 and then 4, so

00:00:25.886 --> 00:00:32.377
the mean is 3.5. There are a lot of different possibilities. These are analogous

00:00:32.377 --> 00:00:38.442
to our samples within the population. Out of our three rolls, we only won one

00:00:38.442 --> 00:00:44.612
time, because we only got one average that's 3 or greater. So how many total

00:00:44.612 --> 00:00:50.934
possibilities, or samples of size 2, can we select from this population? Give it

00:00:50.934 --> 00:00:52.359
your best guess.
