00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.459
&gt;&gt; All scores in the distribution affect the mean. Think of the mean like a

00:00:04.459 --> 00:00:09.275
teeter-totter. Where should the pivot go so that it balances? These rocks or

00:00:09.275 --> 00:00:13.872
balls represent the salaries of the Geography majors. Now, if this were a

00:00:13.872 --> 00:00:18.986
teeter-totter, where should the pivot go so that it balances? That's basically

00:00:18.986 --> 00:00:24.056
the mean, which in this data set of the salaries of Geography majors is 47,718,

00:00:24.056 --> 00:00:29.329
like you calculated. Now, if we were to add another ball, say here, then the

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:34.833
teeter-totter would tip, therefore, the pivot would have to move this way so

00:00:34.833 --> 00:00:40.185
that it keeps balancing. So, you can see that all scores affect the mean. You've

00:00:40.185 --> 00:00:45.268
also seen that the mean can be described with a formula. We describe the sample

00:00:45.268 --> 00:00:50.187
mean as x bar, which is the sum of the values divided by the number of values.

00:00:50.187 --> 00:00:55.562
And the population mean, sum of the values, divided by the number in the

00:00:55.562 --> 00:01:01.105
population. This is also true that many samples from the same population will

00:01:01.105 --> 00:01:06.425
have similar means. For now, I'll just show you this applet again where if we

00:01:06.425 --> 00:01:12.339
pick a sample of size 5, we get that the mean is roughly in the middle. And if

00:01:12.339 --> 00:01:27.112
we do it again, again, we get that the mean is roughly in the middle. Let's do

00:01:27.112 --> 00:01:39.944
it a few more times. Now, we've calculated ten simulated means from this

00:01:39.944 --> 00:01:49.228
distribution and they're all roughly similar. This is actually a very important

00:01:49.228 --> 00:01:53.421
and awesome concept. And we're going to go into this in a lot more depth later

00:01:53.421 --> 00:01:57.732
in the course. Also, the mean of a sample can be used to make inferences about

00:01:57.732 --> 00:02:02.036
the population it came from. This relates to this last property of the mean

00:02:02.036 --> 00:02:06.176
because you saw that all the samples are pretty similar and that they roughly

00:02:06.176 --> 00:02:12.209
approximated the population. It's only the last one that's not a property of the

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:17.554
mean. If we bring up the pivot example again, let's say, we add a stone way out

00:02:17.554 --> 00:02:22.690
here. Is this going to change the mean? You betcha. It's going to have to go to

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.091
the left somewhere so that this will still balance. Let's explore this point a

00:02:28.091 --> 00:02:29.016
little more.
