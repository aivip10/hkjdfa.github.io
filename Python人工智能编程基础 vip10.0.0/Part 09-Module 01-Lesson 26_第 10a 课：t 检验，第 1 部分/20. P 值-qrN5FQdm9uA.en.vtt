00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:08.560
For x bar, or the sample mean, if we add them all up and divide by 8. We should

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:14.172
get 12.625. And for the sample standard deviation, we take the square root of

00:00:14.172 --> 00:00:21.619
each value, minus the mean x bar, square each value. And sum them up, and then

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:29.585
divide by n minus 1. So we should get about 7.596. When we use these values for

00:00:29.585 --> 00:00:33.882
the t statistic, we get 0.977 approximately.
