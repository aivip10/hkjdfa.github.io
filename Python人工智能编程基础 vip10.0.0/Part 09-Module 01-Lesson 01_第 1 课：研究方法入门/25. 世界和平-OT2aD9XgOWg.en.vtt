It sounds logical that happy people don't go to war, but we don't know that

00:00:04.438 --> 00:00:09.050
McDonald's makes people happy, for one thing, and even if it does, many other

00:00:09.062 --> 00:00:13.426
factors could make people unhappy again. For this one, I'm thinking that

00:00:13.438 --> 00:00:18.142
countries that have McDonald's tend to be more economically developed. And

00:00:18.154 --> 00:00:22.386
therefore have more money, so it's implausible they wouldn't be able to afford

00:00:22.398 --> 00:00:26.637
to go to war. That's my own hunch, but I'm pretty sure this is implausible. For

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:30.872
this one, we don't know anything about how many people eat at McDonalds and how

00:00:30.884 --> 00:00:35.166
often, and we don't even know for sure if eating McDonalds would make people too

00:00:35.178 --> 00:00:39.942
unhealthy to engage in a war. This one seems to be the most plausible option.

00:00:40.043 --> 00:00:44.644
Countries with McDonald's are more open to globalization, and less inclined to

00:00:44.656 --> 00:00:49.151
go to war. But I have to admit, that would be pretty awesome if we could obtain

00:00:49.163 --> 00:00:53.800
world peace just by building a McDonald's in every country. If that were true, I

00:00:53.812 --> 00:00:55.845
would definitely advocate for that.
