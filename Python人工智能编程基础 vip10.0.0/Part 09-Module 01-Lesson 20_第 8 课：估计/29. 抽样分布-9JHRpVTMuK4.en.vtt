00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:06.965
Well, the means should be exactly the same. So here it would be 7.5, and here

00:00:06.965 --> 00:00:11.792
8.2. But the standard deviations are the population standard deviation divided

00:00:11.792 --> 00:00:17.222
by the square root of the sample size. This is 0.64 divided by the square root

00:00:17.222 --> 00:00:23.532
of 20, which is about 0.14. And here, it's 0.73 divided by the square root of

00:00:23.532 --> 00:00:29.808
20, which is about 0.16. So, they have almost the same standard deviation. So,

00:00:29.808 --> 00:00:34.632
this is about what the sampling distributions will look like, maybe a little bit

00:00:34.632 --> 00:00:38.304
skinnier. I can't draw much skinnier than this, though.
