00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.659
We controlled for the time at which participants took the pill, the place at

00:00:04.671 --> 00:00:09.028
which they slept, because they all slept in the sleep lab, and what the pill

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.693
looks like? It looks the same for both the active and the placebo. We did not

00:00:13.706 --> 00:00:18.343
however control for gender and age. We can, however, minimize the impact of

00:00:18.355 --> 00:00:23.124
these variables on the results. Let me elaborate on this a little bit. Let's say

00:00:23.136 --> 00:00:27.921
that only females were assigned to the active pill. And only males were assigned

00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:32.661
to the inactive pill. Then, if people who took the active pill slept better. We

00:00:32.673 --> 00:00:37.354
wouldn't know if it was due to the medication in the pill or maybe women just

00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:42.421
sleep better than men. In this particular experiment, we are not controlling for

00:00:42.433 --> 00:00:47.231
these demographic variables, but we can minimize their impact on our results

00:00:47.243 --> 00:00:48.893
through random assignment.
