00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120
It is my absolute pleasure to introduce you to my amazing colleagues,

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.765
who will guide you throughout this program.

00:00:07.765 --> 00:00:10.770
Juno Lee is a former data scientist,

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:15.055
who built neural networks for optimizing users shopping experiences.

00:00:15.055 --> 00:00:20.245
In this program, Juno will focus on programming tools specifically Python,

00:00:20.245 --> 00:00:24.265
one of the most widely used programming languages in the industry.

00:00:24.265 --> 00:00:29.815
Juan Delgado, a computational physicist with a Masters in Astronomy.

00:00:29.815 --> 00:00:31.760
He previously worked for NASA,

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.780
developing space instruments using machine learning techniques.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.875
Juan will teach you some of the programming tools you will need to know.

00:00:39.875 --> 00:00:45.230
Mike Yee, who holds a Bachelor's of Science in mathematics and statistics,

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.505
and received his PhD in cognitive science.

00:00:48.505 --> 00:00:50.540
Mike will teach you Matplotlib,

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.840
the most mature Python package for data visualization.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.005
Jennifer Stab, holds a PhD in Computer Science,

00:00:59.005 --> 00:01:01.535
and Masters in Bio-statistics,

00:01:01.535 --> 00:01:05.675
and was a university Professor of Analytics and Computer Science.

00:01:05.675 --> 00:01:10.670
Jennifer will take you step by step through some of the labs in this nano degree.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.050
The labs will be short implementations in code,

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.195
of the theory you will have learned before.

00:01:17.195 --> 00:01:23.065
Grant Sanderson, is a creator of the YouTube channel 3Blue1Brown,

00:01:23.065 --> 00:01:28.150
which is dedicated to teaching math visually using a custom build animation tool.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.675
He was previously a content creator at Khan Academy.

00:01:31.675 --> 00:01:36.615
Grant will bring you the beautiful visual world of linear algebra.

00:01:36.615 --> 00:01:41.110
Luis Serrano, who worked as a machine learning engineer at Google.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.940
He holds a PhD in Mathematics from the University of Michigan,

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.895
and a Postdoctoral Fellowship at the University of Quebec at Montreal.

00:01:49.895 --> 00:01:54.475
Luis will teach you all you need to know about neural networks.

00:01:54.475 --> 00:01:57.735
Mat Leonard, a former Physicist,

00:01:57.735 --> 00:02:01.080
Research Neuroscientist and Data scientist.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.710
He completed his PhD and Postdoctoral

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.290
Fellowship at the University of California in Berkeley.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.730
You will see Mat throughout the program in various lessons such as Pi torch.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.319
He will also help you create your first project at Udacity, in image classifier.

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:23.605
We are very proud of our diverse community of teachers in the school of AI,

00:02:23.605 --> 00:02:26.760
and can't wait to start teaching you.
