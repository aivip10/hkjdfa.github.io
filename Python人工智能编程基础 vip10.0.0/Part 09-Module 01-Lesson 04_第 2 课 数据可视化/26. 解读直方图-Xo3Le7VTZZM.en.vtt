00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.156
&gt;&gt; What can be said about men's body fat percentage using this histogram? Could

00:00:05.156 --> 00:00:10.331
you say that most scores fall at around 20%? The shape is roughly symmetrical,

00:00:10.331 --> 00:00:15.131
meaning if you fold it, that it'll kind of overlay on each other, or that the

00:00:15.131 --> 00:00:20.256
most common body fat percentage is 35%. &gt;&gt; Most scores fall in the middle of the

00:00:20.256 --> 00:00:26.471
distribution. &gt;&gt; That there are more scores between 15 and 25 than between 35

00:00:26.471 --> 00:00:32.716
and 50. &gt;&gt; Can we say there are more scores between 0 and 10 than between 18 and

00:00:32.716 --> 00:00:39.316
24? Or, finally, can we say that relatively fewer men have a body fat percentage

00:00:39.316 --> 00:00:40.860
above 35 or below 5?
