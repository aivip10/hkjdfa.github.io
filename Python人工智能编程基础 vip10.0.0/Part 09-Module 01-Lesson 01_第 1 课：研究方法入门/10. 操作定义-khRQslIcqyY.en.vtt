Now, when we pick a way of measuring it,
we also kind of have an operational

00:00:05.159 --> 00:00:10.629
definition. So in the BBC study, the
operational definition of a good memory is

00:00:10.641 --> 00:00:16.138
when the percentage of faces correctly
recognized and placed is higher. So once

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:21.474
we have an operational definition, we're
able to measure constructs in the real

00:00:21.486 --> 00:00:21.859
world.
