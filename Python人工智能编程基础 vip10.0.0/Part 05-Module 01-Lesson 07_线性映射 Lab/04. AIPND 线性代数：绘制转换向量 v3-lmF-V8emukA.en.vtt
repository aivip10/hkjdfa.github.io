00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.500
This is the solution's video for

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.360
the linear mapping lab covering computing and plotting a transform vector.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.804
With this lab, you'll be defining transform vector i_hat,

00:00:09.804 --> 00:00:12.945
transform vector j_hat, transform vector v,

00:00:12.945 --> 00:00:17.140
and then plotting transform vector v. In the coding section,

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.530
you would have set x to three and y to one and mark this task as done.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.914
Set x to one and y to two and mark this task as done.

00:00:27.914 --> 00:00:37.689
Then you would have replace none with v_ihat_t plus v_jhat_t and mark this task as done.

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:43.968
Finally, you would have copied the arrow statement for vector v and pasted it here,

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:52.005
changing vector v to vector v under bar t color equal skyblue to color equals b.

00:00:52.005 --> 00:00:56.615
Then you would have saved your code by clicking on the "Save" icon here.

00:00:56.615 --> 00:00:58.270
When we run our code,

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:03.075
we'd expect this plot here will match our expected solution here.

00:01:03.075 --> 00:01:06.379
To run the code, we click on "Kernel",

00:01:06.379 --> 00:01:08.969
"Restart &amp; Run All".

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:13.814
Finally, we compare our plot to the solution and we see that they match.

00:01:13.814 --> 00:01:16.870
So, this means we've coded everything correctly.
