00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.674
Now it's time for a tricky question. What are the mean and standard deviation of

00:00:04.674 --> 00:00:10.345
this sampling distribution? As a hint, remember what the population was. So in

00:00:10.345 --> 00:00:15.955
other words, if we take all possible samples of size 2 from this population, and

00:00:15.955 --> 00:00:21.480
then plotted the mean of each sample, which is this distributionm what will be

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.363
the standard deviation?
