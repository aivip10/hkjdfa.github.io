00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.884
Now why is this called the probability density function? Well, let's say we're

00:00:05.884 --> 00:00:11.797
taking a random sample of Udacity students. Here's a histogram representing

00:00:11.797 --> 00:00:17.873
Udacity students' ages, and the sample size is 7,901. This is actual data. Let's

00:00:17.873 --> 00:00:23.687
model it with this probability density function. Now remember when we model it,

00:00:23.687 --> 00:00:28.506
the absolute frequency turns into relative frequency, and here I've put

00:00:28.506 --> 00:00:33.339
probability and you'll see why. We know from our sample that about 70% of

00:00:33.339 --> 00:00:38.340
Udacity students are aged 30 or less. Now, let's say we randomly choose any

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.380
Udacity student by giving each one of you, and all other Udacity students, a

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.881
unique number. And then we randomly pick a number. Then what's the probability

00:00:48.881 --> 00:00:53.827
that the person that we choose will be age 30 or less. Write your answer as a

00:00:53.827 --> 00:00:54.725
proportion.
