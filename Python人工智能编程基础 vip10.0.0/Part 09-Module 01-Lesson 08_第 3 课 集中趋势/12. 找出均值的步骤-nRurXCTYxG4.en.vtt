00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.773
Geography salaries? Did you do this? Or did you do this? I'm purposely not

00:00:09.773 --> 00:00:14.778
explaining these in full because I want you to really look at it and think about

00:00:14.778 --> 00:00:19.697
what they mean. Or did you do this? Where sum means you add them up. Or did you

00:00:19.697 --> 00:00:24.255
do this? There's more than one answer here. So, check all that you think

00:00:24.255 --> 00:00:28.303
accurately describe calculating the mean of the Geography majors.
