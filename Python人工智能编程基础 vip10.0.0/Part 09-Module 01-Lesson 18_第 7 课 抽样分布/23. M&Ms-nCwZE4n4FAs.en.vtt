00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.025
What we have here today is a sweet demonstration of the sampling distribution of

00:00:04.025 --> 00:00:08.244
the mean, otherwise known as the distribution of sample means. We've laid out 48

00:00:08.244 --> 00:00:12.656
plates each with a bag of M&amp;Ms on it. We're going to dump out these M&amp;Ms,

00:00:12.656 --> 00:00:16.809
there's Dr. Rogers doing so, across all 48 plates. This is a very tedious

00:00:16.809 --> 00:00:23.650
process so we sped things up a little bit to make it go faster. Once we have all

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.043
the M&amp;M's dumped out we're going to separate them by color. We are interested in

00:00:27.043 --> 00:00:30.872
the blue M&amp;M's. Of course, you could pick any color if you wanted. You could use

00:00:30.872 --> 00:00:35.452
orange or green or yellow, but we've chosen blue. Once we've separated out the

00:00:35.452 --> 00:00:40.612
blue M&amp;M's we're going to count them. There I am helping along, Dr. Rogers got

00:00:40.612 --> 00:00:43.741
tired of me sitting over in the corner just watching, so he recruited my help.

00:00:43.741 --> 00:00:48.223
Once we have the blue M&amp;Ms sorted, we're going to be interested in the average

00:00:48.223 --> 00:00:52.912
number of blue M&amp;Ms per bag, or per plate in this case. And what we're going to

00:00:52.912 --> 00:00:58.107
do then is take random sample of n equals 5 and compute an average. Once we've

00:00:58.107 --> 00:01:03.502
done that we're going to do that 50 times, taking 50 random samples, each with n

00:01:03.502 --> 00:01:09.342
equals 5 plates. Then we're going to construct a histogram. That histogram will

00:01:09.342 --> 00:01:15.384
be the distribution of sample means. Remember that the central limit theorem

00:01:15.384 --> 00:01:20.070
says, that the distribution of sample means will be approximately normal, and

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.744
we'll have an expected value of the mean equal to the population mean. Now the

00:01:24.744 --> 00:01:29.554
true population mean we've computed by taking all blue M&amp;Ms across all plates

00:01:29.554 --> 00:01:34.320
and divided them by 48, the number of plates. Remember the central limit theorem

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.544
also says that the standard deviation of the distribution of sample means is

00:01:38.544 --> 00:01:42.900
equal to sigma the population standard deviation divided by the square root of

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.129
the sample size. Let's see how the data turned out
