Now I'm going to show you a little bit of APA style for confidence intervals.

00:00:03.502 --> 00:00:07.942
Usually you put them in parentheses. But we often start by saying what kind of

00:00:07.942 --> 00:00:11.748
interval is this? So, it may some, say something like, here's the confidence

00:00:11.748 --> 00:00:15.574
interval on the mean difference and we present it this way. We'd state the

00:00:15.574 --> 00:00:19.846
level of confidence. Say that we're using a confidence interval which we can

00:00:19.846 --> 00:00:25.090
abbreviate CI, equals, and then in parentheses the lower limit. Comma upper

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.240
limit. An alternative way of presenting this is as follows. We could put 4,

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.822
with a dash 6. Another alternative way is actually writing the word to in there

00:00:33.822 --> 00:00:34.559
to.
