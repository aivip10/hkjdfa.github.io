00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
This is a solution video for the timing code section.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.164
The first thing we have to do is add our name and date to the program.

00:00:08.164 --> 00:00:09.779
I've done that here and then,

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:12.026
I marked that the task was done here.

00:00:12.026 --> 00:00:18.897
Next, we needed to add the timing code within the main function.

00:00:18.897 --> 00:00:24.339
Here, we could see where I set start time to time,

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:34.549
to indicate the time the program started.

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:36.954
Next, we see end time equal time,

00:00:36.954 --> 00:00:40.594
to indicate the time the program ended.

00:00:40.594 --> 00:00:42.729
Here, we compute the total runtime.

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:47.379
Tot time, equals end time minus start time.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.030
Then we have two print statements.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.549
The first print statement just prints the runtime in seconds.

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:58.379
This will be removed in the program after we do this check.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.390
This is only to be used to check the formatting.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.829
Here, we print the total runtime formatted in hour hour, minute minute,

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:11.734
second second like we learned in the timing code concept.

00:01:11.734 --> 00:01:17.289
Note here, we have the sleep function set to 75 seconds.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.330
This is just temporary code that will remove after we've checked the timing code.

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:25.870
This is just to simulate the program running for

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:32.100
75 seconds so we can check the timing and time formatting.

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:36.329
Now, we're going to check our code by running the program.

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.155
In the terminal window,

00:01:39.155 --> 00:01:42.799
type Python, check images dot PY, and hit enter.

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.679
This will run your code.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.080
We ran it for 75 seconds which was

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.799
formatted to a minute and 15 seconds which is expected.

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:54.980
Then, I did a second run where we ran it for 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:00.094
125 seconds which formatted to two minutes and five seconds which is also expected.

00:02:00.094 --> 00:02:03.004
Please remember to remove the sleep function

00:02:03.004 --> 00:02:06.079
and extra print statement before continuing on to the next section.
