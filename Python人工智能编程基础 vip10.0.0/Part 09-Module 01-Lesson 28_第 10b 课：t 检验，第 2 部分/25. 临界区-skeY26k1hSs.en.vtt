The answer is yes. You should have had something that looked like this. Draw

00:00:03.282 --> 00:00:08.250
the t distribution. Place in the critical value. Shade in the critical region,

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.220
and put the t value on this distribution. We know that negative 1.711 is right

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.784
here. We know that negative 2.5 must be below it, which means it's in the

00:00:18.784 --> 00:00:20.649
critical region.
