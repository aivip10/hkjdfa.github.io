00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
This is the solutions video for the Linear Mapping Lab demonstrating that

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.150
a vector transformation can also be achieved by matrix multiplication.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.190
In the coding section of this lab,

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:15.750
we've replaced none by the NumPy function, matmul,

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.274
where the first input argument is matrix ij,

00:00:20.274 --> 00:00:23.759
the second input argument is vector v. Then,

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.635
we've marked this task as done.

00:00:25.635 --> 00:00:28.785
To save our code, we click on the save icon.

00:00:28.785 --> 00:00:30.344
When we run our code,

00:00:30.344 --> 00:00:35.369
our results here should match the expected results that we find down here.

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:39.104
To run the code, we select Kernel,

00:00:39.104 --> 00:00:42.779
Restart and Run All.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.509
Finally, we compare our transform vector v,

00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:49.574
here, with our expected solution here.

00:00:49.575 --> 00:00:51.420
We see that they match,

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.120
so we know we've coded everything correctly.

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:56.000
This completes this section of the lab.
