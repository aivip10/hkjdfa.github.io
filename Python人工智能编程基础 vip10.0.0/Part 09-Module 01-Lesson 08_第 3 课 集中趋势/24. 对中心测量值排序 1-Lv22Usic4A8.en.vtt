00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.360
&gt;&gt; So let's see how measures of center change when we have different

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.582
distributions. On this positively skewed distribution, which do you think is

00:00:07.582 --> 00:00:11.512
true? Do you think the mean is less than the median, which is less than the

00:00:11.512 --> 00:00:15.889
mode? Or do you think the mean is the greatest, and the median is the smallest?

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:20.603
Or do you think the mode is less than the median, is less than the mean? Or do

00:00:20.603 --> 00:00:25.531
you think the median is the greatest and the mode is the smallest? Now remember,

00:00:25.531 --> 00:00:29.826
on the x axis, we go from least to greatest. So, on this distribution, think

00:00:29.826 --> 00:00:34.242
about where the mean, median and mode would lie on the x axis, and choose which

00:00:34.242 --> 00:00:38.572
one of these you think is true. This is a really difficult question that

00:00:38.572 --> 00:00:43.262
requires you to think about everything we've talked about so far, how the median

00:00:43.262 --> 00:00:47.602
and mode are not affected as much by outliers as the mean, how the mode is not

00:00:47.602 --> 00:00:52.222
affected by outliers at all, and how the median will barely change if an outlier

00:00:52.222 --> 00:00:54.336
is added. Give it your best shot.
