00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.885
&gt;&gt; Here are the deviations from the mean. It's always important to maintain

00:00:04.885 --> 00:00:10.512
consistency when you do your calculations. So if you subtract the mean from each

00:00:10.512 --> 00:00:15.888
of these values, in other words, this value minus the mean, you should do this

00:00:15.888 --> 00:00:21.408
with all your calculations rather than going the opposite way, x bar minus xi.
