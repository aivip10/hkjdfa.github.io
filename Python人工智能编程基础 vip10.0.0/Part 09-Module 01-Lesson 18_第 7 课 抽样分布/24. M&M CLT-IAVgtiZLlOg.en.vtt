00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:04.390
Good job. So the mean should be the same as the population mean. And the

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:09.910
standard error should be the population standard deviation divided by the square

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:15.858
root of the sample size. Which is about 1.56. So remember, since these are the

00:00:15.858 --> 00:00:20.742
theoretical mean and standard error based on all possible samples of size five

00:00:20.742 --> 00:00:25.774
from this population, they probably won't get exactly the same standard error as

00:00:25.774 --> 00:00:30.644
what we found. But they should come pretty close. &gt;&gt; So let's see what they got.

00:00:30.644 --> 00:00:35.572
The standard error of the mean computed using this formula, derived from the

00:00:35.572 --> 00:00:40.654
central limit theorem is sigma 3.49 and divided by the square root of our sample

00:00:40.654 --> 00:00:48.700
size 5. So that's 3.49 Divided by the square root of 5 or n, that comes out to

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:54.128
be roughly 1.56. If we took the true standard error of the mean, in other words,

00:00:54.128 --> 00:00:58.684
computed the actual standard deviation for all of the sample means we just took,

00:00:58.684 --> 00:01:04.750
that value is 1.57. Very, very close to that given by the formula. In checking

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.636
the distribution of sample means The sampling distribution of the mean here was

00:01:08.636 --> 00:01:12.815
approximately normal; not perfectly normal, but pretty close. So all in all, we

00:01:12.815 --> 00:01:17.435
see the central limit theorem works. It provides us a useful tool that we'll use

00:01:17.435 --> 00:01:21.865
for the rest of the semester. So, hurray for the central limit theorem!
