00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.684
In addition to statistically deciding if a sample comes from a new population.

00:00:05.684 --> 00:00:09.770
By excepting or rejecting the null. We want to calculate an interval, in which

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.287
the population mean will probably lie. So in this case, we want an interval

00:00:14.287 --> 00:00:20.912
that most likely contains the true average rent. For all rental California's

00:00:20.912 --> 00:00:25.640
units. We'll do essentially the same thing you did in lesson 8. But this time

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.448
using the t statistic since we're using s instead of sigma. Now you've already

00:00:30.448 --> 00:00:36.400
found the t statistics for 2.5% in each tail. What confidence interval will

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.700
this give us? Fill this in
