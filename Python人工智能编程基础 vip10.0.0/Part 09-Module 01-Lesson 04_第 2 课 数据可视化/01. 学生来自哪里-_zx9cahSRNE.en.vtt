Well, most of the students are from China, but it was probably really difficult

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.733
for you to tell from only having the table for 4 seconds. You were probably able

00:00:09.745 --> 00:00:14.331
to glance at the table and see a lot of China written there and so, you might

00:00:14.343 --> 00:00:19.305
have had a sense of which country occurred most frequently. Your brain naturally

00:00:19.317 --> 00:00:24.540
does this, but with statistics We need to be able to formalize this procedure in

00:00:24.552 --> 00:00:29.526
an easy way. That's okay if you didn't get it right this time. The whole point

00:00:29.538 --> 00:00:34.318
was to show you that by just having the table, it's difficult to make quick

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.653
conclusions. So what's a better way?
