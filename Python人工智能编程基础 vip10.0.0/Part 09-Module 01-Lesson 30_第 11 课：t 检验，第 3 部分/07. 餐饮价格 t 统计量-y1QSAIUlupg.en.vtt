00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.240
Here's how I'm symbolizing the standard error, since it's the expected

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.792
difference between the meal prices in Gettysburg and Wilma. But really we can

00:00:07.792 --> 00:00:14.488
symbolize it any way we want. You can even write se or sem. However you'll

00:00:14.488 --> 00:00:18.340
remember it best. Now that we have the standard error, we need to calculate the

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.680
t-statistic. Which of these is correct for calculating the t statistic, or are

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.364
both correct?
