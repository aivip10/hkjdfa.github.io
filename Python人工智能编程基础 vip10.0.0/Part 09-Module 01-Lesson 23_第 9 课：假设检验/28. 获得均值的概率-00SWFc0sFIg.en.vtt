00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.381
The reason we reject the null, is because this probability is so low. Let's

00:00:04.381 --> 00:00:08.996
pretend that the null hypothesis is true, and there's actually not going to be

00:00:08.996 --> 00:00:15.650
a difference between our new population and our current population parameters.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.615
If the null hypothesis is true, what's the probability of getting this sample

00:00:19.615 --> 00:00:24.600
mean? Rated in terms of a proportion. This is just what you did in lesson

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.654
seven. You calculated where the sample mean falls on this distribution of

00:00:28.654 --> 00:00:32.250
sample means, and then you used the Z table to find the probability greater

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.673
than that value.
