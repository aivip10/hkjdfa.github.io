00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.418
For the lower bound, we have our point estimate for the differences, 15.14,

00:00:04.418 --> 00:00:10.525
minus the t critical value. Before using the positive value, we'll subtract it.

00:00:10.525 --> 00:00:15.965
That's the same as adding the negative t critical value, if we were to use that

00:00:15.965 --> 00:00:23.280
one, times the standard error, 15.72. And we get about negative 18.19. Since we

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.620
got a negative value for our lower bound, then it's possible that males own

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:34.290
more shoes than females. That if we subtract them, we'll get a negative value.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:42.326
For our upper bound, we'll do the same thing, 15.14 plus 2.12. And note that

00:00:42.326 --> 00:00:45.910
that's the same as subtracting negative 2.12, if we were to use the negative t

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.490
critical value, times 15.72. This comes out to 48.47. Good job.
