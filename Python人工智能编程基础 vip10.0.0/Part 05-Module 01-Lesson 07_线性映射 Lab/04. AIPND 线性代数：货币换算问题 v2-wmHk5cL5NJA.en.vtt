00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
This is the solutions video for the linear mapping lab.

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.472
For the currency conversion problem,

00:00:04.472 --> 00:00:06.599
that's solved with matrix multiplication.

00:00:06.599 --> 00:00:09.899
With this lab, we'll be using the NumPy matmul function to

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.679
perform matrix multiplication to solve a currency conversion problem.

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.449
In the coding section here,

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:19.054
we've replaced none by the NumPy matmul function,

00:00:19.054 --> 00:00:23.535
where the first input argument is money and the second is conversion rates.

00:00:23.535 --> 00:00:26.089
Then, we mark this task as done.

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:29.980
Next, we save our code by clicking on the "Save" icon.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.570
When we run our code,

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.594
our results will appear here.

00:00:33.594 --> 00:00:37.539
They should match the expected solution that we see here.

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:39.295
To run the code,

00:00:39.295 --> 00:00:43.675
we select "Kernel", "Restart and Run All".

00:00:43.674 --> 00:00:47.634
Finally, we compare our money totals to the solution,

00:00:47.634 --> 00:00:49.449
and we see that they match.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.015
Therefore, we've coded everything correctly.

00:00:52.015 --> 00:00:54.200
This completes this section of the lab
