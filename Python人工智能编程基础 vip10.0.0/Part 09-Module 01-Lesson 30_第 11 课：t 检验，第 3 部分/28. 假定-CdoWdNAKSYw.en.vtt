00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.316
In general, we want to use the pooled variance since it corrects for the

00:00:03.316 --> 00:00:08.050
different sample sizes. In the problem set, you'll get more practice using the

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.850
pooled variance. But the way the t statistic is calculated is essentially the

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.634
same. We divide the observed difference between the mean of X and the mean of Y

00:00:17.634 --> 00:00:23.990
by the standard error, which is calculated slightly differently. Where these

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.908
guys here are this pooled variance. Note that this is the t-statistic when we

00:00:29.908 --> 00:00:36.054
expect that the true populations that these samples come from are the same. In

00:00:36.054 --> 00:00:41.198
other words, that the difference between the population parameters is zero.

00:00:41.198 --> 00:00:46.326
But, say that we expect that the difference is equal to 10, for example. Then

00:00:46.326 --> 00:00:50.681
here, we would subtract this expected difference from the observed difference

00:00:50.681 --> 00:00:56.272
and this observed difference is what we get from our sample. So, this is our

00:00:56.272 --> 00:01:00.965
full t-statistic for independent samples. But in general in this class, our

00:01:00.965 --> 00:01:04.705
null hypothesis has been that there's no significant difference between the two

00:01:04.705 --> 00:01:08.988
populations. In other words, we expect that the difference between the

00:01:08.988 --> 00:01:13.356
parameters is about zero. There are a few assumptions to keep in mind when

00:01:13.356 --> 00:01:18.268
using the pooled variance as there are with any method of measurement. First of

00:01:18.268 --> 00:01:23.720
all, X and Y should be random samples from two independent populations.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.494
Remember when we looked at dependent samples. Data coming from the same subject

00:01:28.494 --> 00:01:34.666
twice. In this case, the population should be independent. The second, is that

00:01:34.666 --> 00:01:39.345
the populations that X and Y come from should be approximately normal. This is

00:01:39.345 --> 00:01:45.358
less important when the sample sizes are very large, greater than 30. A third

00:01:45.358 --> 00:01:49.201
assumption is that the sample data can be used to estimate the population

00:01:49.201 --> 00:01:54.696
variances and finally. The population variances should be roughly equal,

00:01:54.696 --> 00:01:59.130
allowing us to use this pooled variance as an estimate of both.
