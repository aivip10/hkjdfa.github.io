00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:05.010
So if we have a distribution of sample means for all samples of size twenty from

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:10.092
each of these populations, what will be the mean and standard deviation of each

00:00:10.092 --> 00:00:15.543
sampling distribution? So remember, M is the mean of sample means and SE is the

00:00:15.543 --> 00:00:20.853
standard error, so the standard deviation of the sampling distribution.
