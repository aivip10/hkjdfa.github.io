00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.092
&gt;&gt; Here's another way to look at it. Let's say you have a bag of jellybeans.

00:00:05.092 --> 00:00:10.789
There's only one licorice, but there are four strawberries and four blueberries.

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:16.320
There's also only one cherry and two lime, or lemon, I don't know, you decide.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.656
If we take a sample of, say, four Jelly Bellies, most likely, we're not going to

00:00:21.656 --> 00:00:26.926
get the licorice one. Say we just get these in our sample. This sample doesn't

00:00:26.926 --> 00:00:32.125
show the whole range of Jelly Belly flavors that we have, including cherry and

00:00:32.125 --> 00:00:37.117
licorice. So our sample underestimates the variability in our Jelly Belly

00:00:37.117 --> 00:00:42.200
population. Hopefully, this example lends a little more insight into why we

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.005
divide by n minus 1 when calculating the standard deviation of a sample. But

00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:51.936
please let's discuss it in the forums. There, we could go into a lot more depth.

00:00:51.936 --> 00:00:56.344
For the purposes of this class though, as long as you have a basic intuitive

00:00:56.344 --> 00:01:01.385
understanding of the difference between sample standard deviation and population

00:01:01.385 --> 00:01:03.930
standard deviation, then you'll be fine.
