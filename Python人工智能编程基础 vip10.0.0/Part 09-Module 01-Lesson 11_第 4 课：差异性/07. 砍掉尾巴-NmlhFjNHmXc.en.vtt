00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.752
&gt;&gt; One way statisticians deal with outliers is by cutting off the upper and

00:00:04.752 --> 00:00:09.873
lower tails of the distribution. So we're going to cut off Mark Zuckerberg. Then

00:00:09.873 --> 00:00:14.804
we only consider the data values in the middle. What do we mean by cut off the

00:00:14.804 --> 00:00:19.142
tails? Traditionally, statisticians cut the lower 25 percent and the upper 25

00:00:19.142 --> 00:00:24.093
percent. So let's say you have eight data values. We're going to cut off the

00:00:24.093 --> 00:00:29.646
bottom two, or the bottom 25 percent, and the top two, the top 25 percent. So

00:00:29.646 --> 00:00:33.940
all we care about are, are these values in the middle.
