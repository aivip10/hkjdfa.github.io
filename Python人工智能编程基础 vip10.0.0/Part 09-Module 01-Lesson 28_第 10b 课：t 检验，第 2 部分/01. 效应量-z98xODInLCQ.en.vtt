00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.080
One important aspect of any research study is something called the Effect Size.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.792
In experimental studies, or studies with a treatment variable, effect size

00:00:07.792 --> 00:00:12.520
refers to the size of a treatment effect. Makes intuitive sense. In non

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.417
experimental studies. The term effect size may refer to the strength of the

00:00:16.417 --> 00:00:21.002
relationship between our variables. In the Z-test or in the t-test, the

00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:24.542
simplest measure effect size is the mean difference which is simply the

00:00:24.542 --> 00:00:30.905
difference between the two means. In the Z-test or the one sample t-test, the

00:00:30.905 --> 00:00:35.813
mean difference is x bar minus mu. Mean differences are great when we have

00:00:35.813 --> 00:00:39.832
variables with easy to understand meanings. In other words, those that we can

00:00:39.832 --> 00:00:42.469
understand without any specialized training.
