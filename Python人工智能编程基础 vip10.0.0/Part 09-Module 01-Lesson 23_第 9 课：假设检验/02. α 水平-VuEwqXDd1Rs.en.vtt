00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.919
Our alpha level is our criterion for deciding whether or not something is

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:09.535
likely or unlikely. If the probability is less than alpha then it is considered

00:00:09.535 --> 00:00:14.711
unlikely. If a sample mean has a z score greater than z star this means the

00:00:14.711 --> 00:00:21.420
probability of selecting this sample mean is even smaller. Therefore, this

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.546
second is also true. If we consider sample means, with z-scores greater than

00:00:26.546 --> 00:00:30.490
z-star to be unlikely, then if it falls in the orange region it would be

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:37.230
considered likely, in this case. Therefore this third one is not true. And

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.450
finally, the alpha level is .05, which is 5% which corresponds to the green

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.213
region, not the orange.
