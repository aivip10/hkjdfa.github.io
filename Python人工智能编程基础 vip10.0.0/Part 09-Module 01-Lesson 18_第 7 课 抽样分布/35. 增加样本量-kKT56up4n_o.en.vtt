00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:06.744
Again, the standard error will be the population standard deviation, divided by

00:00:06.744 --> 00:00:12.696
the square root of the sample size, which is now 250. So now, the denominator is

00:00:12.696 --> 00:00:18.212
bigger which means that the standard error will be smaller. And indeed it's

00:00:18.212 --> 00:00:24.302
1.01. So, let's write it over here. So, this sampling distribution is going to

00:00:24.302 --> 00:00:25.593
be a lot skinnier.
