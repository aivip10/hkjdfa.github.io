00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.656
You might have guessed that it's going to be skinnier, because if n increases

00:00:05.656 --> 00:00:11.376
from 2 to 5, the denominator of this standard deviation of the distribution is

00:00:11.376 --> 00:00:16.490
going to be bigger. Meaning that this standard deviation or this standard error

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.935
is going to be smaller, that means that the distribution of sample mean is going

00:00:20.935 --> 00:00:24.832
to be skinnier. But it's also great if you use the applet, because that's a

00:00:24.832 --> 00:00:30.389
really good visualization tool. Let's do that. So we'll roll five dice, and then

00:00:30.389 --> 00:00:35.558
take the average of all the numbers that show up at the top. And then we'll do

00:00:35.558 --> 00:00:40.094
this at least 100 times. Let's do it a 1000 times. And you see we have a

00:00:40.094 --> 00:00:46.280
skinnier normal distribution. Again let's compare this to if we only rolled two

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.672
dice. Then we get a much wider distribution.
