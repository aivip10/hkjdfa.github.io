00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.802
Think back to what you've learned before in lesson six. Approximately what

00:00:04.802 --> 00:00:09.526
percent of sample means fall within what distance of the population mean? Now

00:00:09.526 --> 00:00:14.407
this is kind of a tricky question. Remember we're not talking about the

00:00:14.407 --> 00:00:20.750
population, we're talking about the sampling distribution. So what percent of

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.793
sample means fall within how far of the population mean?
