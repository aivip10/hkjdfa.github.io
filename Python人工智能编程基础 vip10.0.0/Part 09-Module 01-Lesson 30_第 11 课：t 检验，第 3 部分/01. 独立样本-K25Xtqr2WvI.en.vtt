00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.480
Welcome to Lesson 11. In Lesson 10, you learned about dependent samples or

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.974
repeated measures. Just to refresh your memory, that could be where we give the

00:00:08.974 --> 00:00:14.002
same person two different conditions to see how they react to each one. Maybe a

00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:18.848
control and then a treatment, or maybe two types of treatments. Or, this could

00:00:18.848 --> 00:00:23.072
be longitudinal, where we measure some variable at some point in time, and then

00:00:23.072 --> 00:00:28.366
again at another and see if the variable changes. Or this could be a pre-test

00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:31.976
and post-test. What was the measurement of a variable before and after a

00:00:31.976 --> 00:00:36.028
treatment? These are just a few situations in which we would use dependent

00:00:36.028 --> 00:00:41.372
samples. This type of research design is really useful because it controls for

00:00:41.372 --> 00:00:46.144
indivdual differences. In other words, if we gave someone some kind of

00:00:46.144 --> 00:00:50.088
treatment, then those same individual differences will be present the next time

00:00:50.088 --> 00:00:55.470
we give that same treatment. That way we can see how two different treatments

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.655
play out under the same conditions. Because there's controls for individual

00:01:00.655 --> 00:01:05.019
differeneces, we could then use fewer subjects. And this is more cost

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:10.796
effective, less time consuming, and generally less expensive. However, there

00:01:10.796 --> 00:01:16.247
are also a few disadvantages. One of which, is carry-over effects. For example,

00:01:16.247 --> 00:01:20.328
let's say we have this new method of teaching math. You want to know if it's

00:01:20.328 --> 00:01:24.127
going to be effective. If you use the same group of students to test this new

00:01:24.127 --> 00:01:27.962
teaching method, inevitably, they're going to be better at math the second time

00:01:27.962 --> 00:01:32.700
around. So, if the first time we teach them one way, and then the second lesson

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.950
we teach them a different way, they'll already be better at math from learning

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.130
it the first time. Then we don't know if the results after the second treatment

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.320
are due to the fact that it was effective or due to the fact that they've

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.860
learned math before. That's just one example. The second measurement can be

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.766
affected by the first treatment. And the order in which we give the treatment

00:01:54.766 --> 00:01:58.664
might influence the results. For example, say we want to test two types of

00:01:58.664 --> 00:02:02.859
pills. What if the first pill has some kind of interaction with the second

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:09.066
pill? And so, by taking it in that order they affect the results. Therefore, in

00:02:09.066 --> 00:02:13.784
this lesson, you're going to learn about independent samples. Whereas,

00:02:13.784 --> 00:02:18.131
dependent samples deals with within subject designs, independent samples deals

00:02:18.131 --> 00:02:23.780
with between subject designs. In this case, the advantages of dependent samples

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.434
are the disadvantages of independent samples. And the disadvantages of

00:02:28.434 --> 00:02:33.453
dependent samples are the advantages of independent samples. Does that make

00:02:33.453 --> 00:02:37.744
sense? With independent samples, we need more subjects because we need to

00:02:37.744 --> 00:02:43.292
randomize the two groups taking the two treatments. We need a larger end to

00:02:43.292 --> 00:02:48.358
control for individual differences as best as possible. That means it's more

00:02:48.358 --> 00:02:52.244
time consuming and generally more expensive. But then the advantages of

00:02:52.244 --> 00:02:56.798
independent samples are that we don't have carry over effects. Therefore, we

00:02:56.798 --> 00:03:00.254
can give one treatment to one group, another treatment to another group, and

00:03:00.254 --> 00:03:03.818
not worry about one treatment effecting the other, because each person or each

00:03:03.818 --> 00:03:10.108
subject only gets one treatment. With independent samples, we can do an

00:03:10.108 --> 00:03:16.016
experimental test where we give treatments to the subjects. Or observational,

00:03:16.016 --> 00:03:20.164
where we simply observe characteristics of two different populations, and then

00:03:20.164 --> 00:03:26.518
compare them. Everything is exactly the same. The Null and Alternative

00:03:26.518 --> 00:03:32.681
Hypotheses, the t-statistic, and the way we make our statistical decision.
