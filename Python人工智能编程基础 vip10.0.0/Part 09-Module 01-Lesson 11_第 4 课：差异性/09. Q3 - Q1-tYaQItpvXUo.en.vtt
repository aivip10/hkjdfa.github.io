00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:06.161
&gt;&gt; So again we'll split the data in half, so five below, five above. And then

00:00:06.161 --> 00:00:12.530
we'll find the median of the first half, which is 49,191, so this is Q1. If we

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:19.177
find the median of the second half, we get 54,135 or Q3. The difference between

00:00:19.177 --> 00:00:23.992
them if 4,944. This is a lot more representative of the variability of this

00:00:23.992 --> 00:00:27.179
distribution than if we included Mark Zuckerberg.
