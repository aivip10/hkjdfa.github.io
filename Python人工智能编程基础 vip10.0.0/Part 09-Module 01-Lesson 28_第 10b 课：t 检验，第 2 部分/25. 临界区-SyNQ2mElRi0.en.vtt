Okay. For this next question, draw the t distribution. Do that first. Next,

00:00:04.985 --> 00:00:09.799
place t critical on the distribution. Put it in its proper location. Shade in

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:14.015
the critical region. Finally, place t on the t distribution. Make sure you have

00:00:14.015 --> 00:00:17.844
all four of these completed before we move to the next slide. Does t fall in

00:00:17.844 --> 00:00:19.949
the critical region? Yes or no?
