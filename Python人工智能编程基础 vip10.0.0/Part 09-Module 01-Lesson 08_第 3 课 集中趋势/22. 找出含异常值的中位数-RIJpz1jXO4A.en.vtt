00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.830
&gt;&gt; The number right in between these two numbers, smack dab in the middle, is

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.082
50,915. You may have realized this, but this is the average of those two middle

00:00:10.082 --> 00:00:15.469
numbers. We always take the average of the two middle numbers when finding the

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:20.779
median of data sets with an even number of scores. So, in this case, there are 6

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:21.360
scores.
