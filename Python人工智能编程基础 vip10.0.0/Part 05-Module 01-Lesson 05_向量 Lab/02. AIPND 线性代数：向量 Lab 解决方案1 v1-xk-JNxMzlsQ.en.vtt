Hi students, Jennifer here.

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:04.469
I'm going to guide you through the solutions videos

00:00:04.469 --> 00:00:07.285
for the Linear Algebra Essentials Labs.

00:00:07.285 --> 00:00:09.810
This is the solutions video for the Vector Lab,

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.365
covering multiplying a vector by a scalar and plotting the results.

00:00:14.365 --> 00:00:17.429
First, we need to replace none with the definition of

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:22.375
vector av by multiplying vector v by scalar a.

00:00:22.375 --> 00:00:27.515
Here, we've coded av equals a times v,

00:00:27.515 --> 00:00:29.984
and then mark this task is done.

00:00:29.984 --> 00:00:35.685
Next, we need to add vector av to the plot as a dotted cyan arrow.

00:00:35.685 --> 00:00:41.569
We'll copy the arrow statement from vector v and place it down here.

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:46.140
Then, we'll change vector v to vector av,

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.119
color equals b to color equals c. Then,

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:52.909
we'll add line style equals dotted.

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:57.379
This will add vector av to our plot so that what we

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:03.080
have here will then look like the solution that we see here.

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.834
Next, we click on the "Save" icon to save our work.

00:01:06.834 --> 00:01:09.265
Then, we select Kernel,

00:01:09.265 --> 00:01:12.010
Restart and Run All to run

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.085
the code in all the cells to visualize the changes we've made to the plot.

00:01:16.084 --> 00:01:19.884
Finally, we compare our plot to the solution.

00:01:19.885 --> 00:01:23.915
And we see that we've coded everything correctly.

00:01:23.915 --> 00:01:25.730
This completes the section of the lab.
