00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.260
&gt;&gt; Well with Zuckerberg, there is an outlier here, so C must be the box plot

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:09.012
that corresponds to this distribution with Mark Zuckerberg, and without Mark

00:00:09.012 --> 00:00:13.942
Zuckerberg, it'll look pretty much the same. The interquartile range as you saw

00:00:13.942 --> 00:00:18.486
before will remain the same, as will the min and maximum value, not including

00:00:18.486 --> 00:00:23.083
Mark Zuckerberg. In this one, since it's more spread out and it has a larger

00:00:23.083 --> 00:00:28.552
interquartile range. Corresponds to this dot plot. Of course, these values would

00:00:28.552 --> 00:00:33.388
have to be exactly placed on a number line for it to be an accurate box plot.

00:00:33.388 --> 00:00:38.399
But in general, this is how the box plots will look differently from each other

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.434
for different distributions.
