00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.849
Now, this is an incredibly tough question. Even though we've gone over this

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:10.605
before, and I've taught you how we compute this, it is pretty difficult. And it

00:00:10.605 --> 00:00:15.399
takes some time to really grasp what's going on here. So, we're going to go

00:00:15.399 --> 00:00:20.944
through this again. Bear with me, and you'll get it eventually I promise, if you

00:00:20.944 --> 00:00:26.640
don't already. We know that 95% of sample means will be within 1.96 standard

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.668
deviations of the population mean, which is also the mean of sample means. Now,

00:00:32.668 --> 00:00:37.536
let's just zoom in on this part over here. This sample mean doesn't change. It's

00:00:37.536 --> 00:00:43.851
there. But if it's going to be one of the 95% of sample means that falls within

00:00:43.851 --> 00:00:50.752
1.96 standard deviations from the mean, then the population mean can range from

00:00:50.752 --> 00:00:55.999
here to here. So, this here is the range in which the population mean of

00:00:55.999 --> 00:01:01.944
everyone who uses the Bieber Tweeter is most likely to fall. So, you see that

00:01:01.944 --> 00:01:10.023
this range is 40 plus 1.96 standard deviations and 40 minus 1.96 deviations. And

00:01:10.023 --> 00:01:15.765
we know that since this is the same shape as our sampling distribution, that our

00:01:15.765 --> 00:01:21.594
standard deviation is the population standard deviation divided by the square

00:01:21.594 --> 00:01:25.524
root of n. I know I just said a lot of confusing things, so let's write it out.

00:01:25.525 --> 00:01:32.428
So her,e we should have 40 minus 1.96 standard deviations, and then 40 plus 1.96

00:01:32.428 --> 00:01:38.835
standard deviations. And we know that the standard deviation is our standard

00:01:38.835 --> 00:01:48.957
error, okay? So, we already know that our standard error is 2.71. So, you have

00:01:48.957 --> 00:02:01.390
40 minus 1.96 times 2.71, and 40 plus 1.96 times 2.71. So this is about 34.69 to

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.334
45.31. So, our confidence interval for the population mean is something like

00:02:07.334 --> 00:02:13.370
this. So, if everyone were to use the Bieber Tweeter, our point estimate is 40,

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.076
and our interval estimate is our 95% confidence interval.
