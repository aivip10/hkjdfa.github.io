00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.911
Now, we might not just be interested in the absolute numbers, but instead, how

00:00:04.923 --> 00:00:09.775
these numbers relate to each other. In other words, we might want to know the

00:00:09.787 --> 00:00:14.971
proportion of students from each country, understanding how many students from

00:00:14.983 --> 00:00:19.888
each country make up the whole. This is called the relative frquency. For

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:26.827
example, 2 out of 50 students in this sample are from Canada, 2 divided by 50 is

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:33.767
0.04. 0.04 is the proportion of students from Canada. Try calculating

00:00:33.779 --> 00:00:38.209
proportions yourself for China, Germany, and Japan.
