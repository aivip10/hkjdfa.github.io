00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.183
Brands use Klout to reach out to the influencers for word of mass marketing. So

00:00:05.183 --> 00:00:09.246
for example Audi has this test drive campaign that they offer to

00:00:09.246 --> 00:00:14.007
influencers in San Francisco. They basically invited all those opinion leaders

00:00:14.007 --> 00:00:18.147
in different vectors of the industry to come in and test drive one of this

00:00:18.147 --> 00:00:23.106
newest model, and get a sense of how they feel about this new model. That's what

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:28.110
Audi do. And Virgin America for example offered this VIP service for those,

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.970
who are even just a Klout user, when they come to the airport terminals, they

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.722
invite those influences over to their VIP lounge, just for all the pros they have

00:00:37.722 --> 00:00:42.505
there. Because you know, they think having a Klout score is a good indicator of

00:00:42.505 --> 00:00:48.552
you being influential and savvy was this social media thing that's coming up. So,

00:00:48.553 --> 00:00:53.158
and people has different ways of using Klout scores across different domains. I've

00:00:53.158 --> 00:00:57.884
also heard of some dating sites using Klout score as a signal to match people up.

00:00:57.884 --> 00:01:02.918
&gt;&gt; Cool, are there any other ways that you can think of often top of your head. &gt;&gt; Some

00:01:02.918 --> 00:01:08.879
CMOs - chief marketing officers uses Klout to just filter their candidates with.

00:01:08.879 --> 00:01:13.302
Because a lot of the bigger, more traditional companies, when they try to adapt

00:01:13.302 --> 00:01:17.397
to their social media era, they're trying to hire someone with social media

00:01:17.397 --> 00:01:22.658
background. To be able to help with their branding and, and, and the picture of

00:01:22.658 --> 00:01:28.696
their company. And for those jobs, having a Klout score is a must. I've heard. I think

00:01:28.696 --> 00:01:33.092
Barrack Obama, the President, has the highest Klout score of 99. And San

00:01:33.092 --> 00:01:37.784
Francisco Giants just recently after they won the World's Series, they had

00:01:37.784 --> 00:01:43.329
a share that same score for a month. &gt;&gt; Wow, and Justin Bieber? &gt;&gt; Justin Bieber

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:48.870
has a very high Klout score of 92. And a lot of celebrities and media

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.691
celebrities are a whiz in their range. And but he's one of, definitely one of

00:01:53.691 --> 00:01:55.256
the highest Klout score.
