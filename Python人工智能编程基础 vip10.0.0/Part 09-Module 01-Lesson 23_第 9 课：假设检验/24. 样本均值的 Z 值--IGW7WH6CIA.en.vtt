00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.828
Now let's say we take a sample of 30 students and we make the lesson with the

00:00:03.828 --> 00:00:09.860
song available to them. Afterwards, the mean engagement score they report is

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.466
8.3. Where does this value fall on the distribution of sample means for all

00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:19.310
samples of size 30? To answer this remember that this normal distribution

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.850
represent the distribution of sample mean. Remember that the mean of sample

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.512
means should be the same as the population mean. And the standard deviation

00:00:29.512 --> 00:00:34.504
should be the population standard deviation divided by the square root of n. We

00:00:34.504 --> 00:00:38.787
want to find where on this distribution the sample mean will fall. In other

00:00:38.787 --> 00:00:40.513
words, what's the z score?
