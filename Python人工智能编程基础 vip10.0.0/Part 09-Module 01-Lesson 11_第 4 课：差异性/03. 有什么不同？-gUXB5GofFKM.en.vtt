00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.999
Well, it looks like the general population is pretty spread out. It ranges from

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:10.011
really low salary to really high salary, so we can automatically say this one.

00:00:10.011 --> 00:00:15.117
That means also that people with the social networking accounts, their salaries

00:00:15.117 --> 00:00:20.023
are more consistent because it's closer together. And then, we can say that the

00:00:20.023 --> 00:00:24.627
salaries of the general public are more consistent. We actually cannot say this

00:00:24.627 --> 00:00:29.064
one. Because this is the general population, and it could include people that

00:00:29.064 --> 00:00:33.708
have social networking accounts. So, these high salaries up here, we don't know

00:00:33.708 --> 00:00:38.457
if they have social networking accounts or not. And we also can't see this

00:00:38.457 --> 00:00:40.698
fourth one for the same reason.
