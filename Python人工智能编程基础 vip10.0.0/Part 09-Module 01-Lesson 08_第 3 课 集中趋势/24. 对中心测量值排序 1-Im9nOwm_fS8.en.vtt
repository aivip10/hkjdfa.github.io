00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.918
&gt;&gt; In this case, the mode is less than the median, is less than the mean. If you

00:00:04.918 --> 00:00:09.956
got this, great job. This was a really difficult question, so don't beat

00:00:09.956 --> 00:00:15.276
yourself up if you didn't get it. Let's analyze this. We can tell that the mode

00:00:15.276 --> 00:00:20.548
is here, in this bin. Now, since this distribution is skewed, these values out

00:00:20.548 --> 00:00:26.042
here will pull the mean more than the median. So, that means the mean will be

00:00:26.042 --> 00:00:30.605
maybe somewhere around there, but the median should be less.
