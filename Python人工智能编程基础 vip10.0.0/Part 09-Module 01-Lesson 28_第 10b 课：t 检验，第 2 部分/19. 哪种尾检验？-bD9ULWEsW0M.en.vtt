00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.522
The correct answer is a one tail test in the negative direction. This is

00:00:04.522 --> 00:00:08.542
because, when we compute our T test, we expect a negative value, in other

00:00:08.542 --> 00:00:13.965
words, we expect x bar to be smaller than mu. So, here's where our critical

00:00:13.965 --> 00:00:17.566
region would be. Notice, we wouldn't do a two tail test because our alternative

00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:21.752
hypothesis says we're only looking for a negative difference. Which is also why

00:00:21.752 --> 00:00:24.680
we wouldn't do a one tail test in the positive direction and a 3 tail test, I

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.900
just made that up. There's no such thing.
