00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.058
&gt;&gt; The answer is no, although usually it is, especially for symmetrical

00:00:05.058 --> 00:00:10.626
distributions like these, the mean will generally be in between q1 and q3 and

00:00:10.626 --> 00:00:16.315
close to the median if it's perfectly symmetrical. But take this data set for

00:00:16.315 --> 00:00:22.363
example. It has this outlier 90. Q1 is 1 because here's the median with six data

00:00:22.363 --> 00:00:28.443
values on either side And if we split this half of the data in half, the average

00:00:28.443 --> 00:00:33.858
of 1 and 1 is just 1, and if we split this data in half, we get that q 3 is 3,

00:00:33.858 --> 00:00:39.748
but if we calculate the mean, we get that the mean is 8.62, which is a lot more

00:00:39.748 --> 00:00:40.481
than q 3.
