00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:06.187
Remember that we can have all sorts of normal distributions wide or skinny but

00:00:06.187 --> 00:00:12.267
the total area underneath the density curve will always be one and for normal

00:00:12.267 --> 00:00:18.632
distributions approximately 68% is within one standard deviation of the mean and

00:00:18.632 --> 00:00:25.076
95% is within two standard deviations of the mean. So, what proportion of data

00:00:25.076 --> 00:00:31.740
values is either below two standard deviations or above two standard deviations

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:38.115
from the mean? And this is for a normal distribution. Write your answer as a

00:00:38.115 --> 00:00:39.255
proportion.
