If you're a Udacity student you can earn karma points by posting questions in the

00:00:05.017 --> 00:00:10.057
forums or answering others questions. If someone likes your question or your

00:00:10.057 --> 00:00:15.127
answer you can earn 15 karma points. If the person who asked a question accepts

00:00:15.127 --> 00:00:20.378
your answer you can earn 25 karma points. And if you accept some of the answer

00:00:20.378 --> 00:00:25.191
you can earn 5 points. However, you can also lose karma points by being

00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:30.626
downloaded by having a flagged post or if your flagged post is deleted. Most of

00:00:30.626 --> 00:00:35.956
these students are pretty awesome, see they are all in the positives and if you

00:00:35.956 --> 00:00:41.286
have a certain number of karma points you can even edit other people's posts or

00:00:41.286 --> 00:00:47.663
delete others posts. The karma point system is explained in the Udacity FAQ section. I

00:00:47.663 --> 00:00:52.974
put the link at the bottom. Well, I put together a data set for you guys to

00:00:52.974 --> 00:00:58.939
analyze, which is the average number of Karma points per post. This data set has

00:00:58.939 --> 00:01:03.252
200 students. Click the link I shared to access this data.
