00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:06.753
&gt;&gt; So, here's the data and you see that people entered this data on January 2nd,

00:00:06.753 --> 00:00:13.387
and that the data goes all the way down to cell B28, right here, and it starts

00:00:13.387 --> 00:00:20.609
at cell B2. Now, we can calculate the average anywhere in this white space. So,

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:27.952
let's pick this one, looks like a good cell, good old cell D4. So, we'll write

00:00:27.952 --> 00:00:35.776
equals average of cell B2 all the way to B28. Now, we'll just make sure that all

00:00:35.776 --> 00:00:43.290
of the data is highlighted with this dotted green line. That way, we know that

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.717
we are accounting for all of these data. And then we push Enter. So, you should

00:00:49.717 --> 00:00:56.383
have gotten that the average Udacian, at least in this sample, has 585 Facebook

00:00:56.383 --> 00:01:04.167
friends. Another way to do that is to sum cells B2 to B28 and then divide by how

00:01:04.167 --> 00:01:11.811
many people there are. So, there are 27 people and we get the same thing because

00:01:11.811 --> 00:01:19.811
remember, what we just did here when we took the sum of all the data values then

00:01:19.811 --> 00:01:27.477
divided by n, that's the formula for the mean, for any dataset. And that's what

00:01:27.477 --> 00:01:32.852
you worked with earlier in this lesson. So, spreadsheets are not only useful,

00:01:32.852 --> 00:01:37.644
but they're a great way to look at the same concepts in a different way.
