00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.600
What if we wanted to find the median number of friends using this spreadsheet?

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.994
Remember, that first we want to order the data. So, there's a very useful tool

00:00:08.994 --> 00:00:13.624
called Sort which is in pretty much all spreadsheet software. In Google

00:00:13.624 --> 00:00:19.400
spreadsheets, the way you do it is by first highlighting the data. And I'm

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.440
going to show you a keyboard shortcut really quick. From cell A2, hit Shift and

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:30.538
then Right arrow key, so it highlights cell A2 and B2. And then, Command,

00:00:30.538 --> 00:00:36.138
Shift, Down arrow key. And then, this highlights all the data. It's easier to

00:00:36.138 --> 00:00:39.290
do it this way than by simply dragging your cursor all the way down to the

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.460
bottom. This is just a quick and easy way to highlight all the data. So now,

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.425
click on Data, and we want to sort by column B because that's the data we're

00:00:48.425 --> 00:00:54.140
interested in. We're not really interested in the time stamp. So we'll click

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.180
Sort Range, and then we should get a box here saying, Sort Range By, and we'll

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:06.180
say column B. And in general, we want to sort from least to greatest. So, I'm

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.491
going to stop here and let you try and experiment with this. And then after you

00:01:11.491 --> 00:01:15.180
sort the data in the spreadsheet, try finding the median
