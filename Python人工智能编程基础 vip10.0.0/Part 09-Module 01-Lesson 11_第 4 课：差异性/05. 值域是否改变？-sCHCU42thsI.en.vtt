00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.734
&gt;&gt; Range sometimes changes when we add new data to the data set. We could add a

00:00:04.734 --> 00:00:09.508
lot of data values here in the middle and it would really change the shape of

00:00:09.508 --> 00:00:14.606
our distribution. But it wouldn't change the range. Same here. So instead of a

00:00:14.606 --> 00:00:19.291
187, we could have 190. We could keep adding values to the data set and the

00:00:19.291 --> 00:00:23.933
range would never change. But if we added a value out here higher than the

00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:28.920
maximum value or out here or even down here. It would change the range of our

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.556
data set. We lose detail with the range because it's only based on two scores.

00:00:33.556 --> 00:00:38.331
And these scores are the most extreme in the distribution. These extreme values

00:00:38.331 --> 00:00:42.384
are likely not very representative of the rest of the distribution.
