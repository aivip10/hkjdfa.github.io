00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.180
So, we're not going to use confidence intervals for this. Now, we don't know the

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.912
results yet because I'm just giving you this poll. But let's pretend that we get

00:00:08.912 --> 00:00:13.975
an average of 7.5 for how engaged you are, and an average of 8.2 for how much

00:00:13.975 --> 00:00:18.867
you think you're learning. So, these are hypothetical population parameters. Mu

00:00:18.867 --> 00:00:25.233
sub E for engagement, and Mu sub L for learning. We would say the associated

00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:31.058
standard deviations are 0.64 and 0.73. Now, let's say our distributions look

00:00:31.058 --> 00:00:35.630
like this, for each measure, so they're negatively skewed. And let's say I want

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.595
to get these means up, I'm going to try to do this by writing a song about the

00:00:39.595 --> 00:00:43.651
concepts in the next lesson, and then singing it. Maybe it'll help you stay

00:00:43.651 --> 00:00:48.649
engaged, because hearing a song can be entertaining. Maybe it'll help you learn,

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:53.539
because hearing a song can you remember the concept and what it is. However, I'm

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:58.621
not totally sure at this point that it might actually help rather than hurt your

00:00:58.621 --> 00:01:03.103
learning. So, instead of giving everybody this lesson without a clue as to

00:01:03.103 --> 00:01:07.292
whether or not it's going to help, I'm just going to give this lesson to a

00:01:07.292 --> 00:01:12.860
random sample of 20 students. Then, I have them anonymously take the same poll

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.243
you just did. Let's say we get the following sample means.
