00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.322
&gt;&gt; We take the square root. If we know the area of this square, then if we take

00:00:05.322 --> 00:00:10.888
the square root, we end up with just the length of one of the sides. Since it's

00:00:10.888 --> 00:00:16.361
a square, all the side lengths are the same. So, for example, if the area of

00:00:16.361 --> 00:00:22.074
this square is 49, then each side length would be 7. That side length of the

00:00:22.074 --> 00:00:28.361
square is the standard way of measuring the variability. And it's called the

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:29.972
standard deviation.
