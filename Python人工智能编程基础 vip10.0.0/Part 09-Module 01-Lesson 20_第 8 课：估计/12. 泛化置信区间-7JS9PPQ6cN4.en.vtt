00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.578
Well, this value here is just a point. It's mu, which is what we already know,

00:00:06.578 --> 00:00:13.422
the mean clock score, 37.72 in our last example, plus 1.96. It doesn't really

00:00:13.422 --> 00:00:19.122
make sense to add a z score, so this value is not an interval and it doesn't

00:00:19.122 --> 00:00:23.180
even make sense. Here, we're getting a little closer because now we have an

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.698
interval. But as I said before, it doesn't make sense to just subtract a z score

00:00:28.698 --> 00:00:33.846
because this is the number of standard deviations away from the mean, so we want

00:00:33.846 --> 00:00:38.944
to find the value along the x-axis for this interval. This one looks more

00:00:38.944 --> 00:00:44.970
promising. We have our sample mean. And we subtract 1.96 standard deviations,

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.730
and since the standard deviation is sigma divided by root n that would be this

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.400
value here, and then if we add 1.96 standard deviations that would give this

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.077
value here. And that is our confidence interval. So, we found the answer. But

00:01:01.077 --> 00:01:05.665
let's explore this one anyway. This one we can't even figure out what it is

00:01:05.665 --> 00:01:11.480
because we don't know this population mean after the intervention. So, we're not

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.740
able to compute this. If you selected this one, then you were pretty close. So,

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.543
good job.
