00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.280
Now I'd like to talk about a topic that is sometimes confusing for students,

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:08.205
and that is the topic of statistical significance. Statistical significance in

00:00:08.205 --> 00:00:12.510
the area of statistics has a very specialized meaning. It's kind of

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.216
counterintuitive. It doesn't really fit what we normally think of in terms of

00:00:16.216 --> 00:00:21.102
significance. So, in everyday life, we use the word significant to talk about

00:00:21.102 --> 00:00:25.392
things that are important to us, things that are large or sizable, things that

00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:31.288
are meaningful. In statistics, the phrase statistical significance has none of

00:00:31.288 --> 00:00:35.199
these meanings. I'm going to write on the other side what significance does

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:39.610
mean. Significance does mean that we've rejected the null hypothesis.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.610
Significance also means that our results are not likely due to chance or

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.424
sampling error. Notice that this and this are just two different ways of saying

00:00:47.424 --> 00:00:51.006
the same thing. The important point is to know when you see the words

00:00:51.006 --> 00:00:55.332
statistical significance, it doesn't mean that our results were important. That

00:00:55.332 --> 00:00:59.312
they were large or sizable or that they were even meaningful. All it means is

00:00:59.312 --> 00:01:03.143
that the results are probably not due to chance. In other words, we've ruled

00:01:03.143 --> 00:01:07.398
random chance at or sampling error as an explanation of our results. That's an

00:01:07.398 --> 00:01:10.996
important point to keep in mind. So how do we know if the results of a research

00:01:10.996 --> 00:01:14.330
study were meaningful or important? One thing we have to know is what was

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.546
measured? What were the variables? Did the variables have practical or social

00:01:18.546 --> 00:01:22.868
importance or even theoretical importance? Obviously, if our variables do not

00:01:22.868 --> 00:01:26.092
have any importance in terms of practical application, social issues, or

00:01:26.092 --> 00:01:29.524
theory, then clearly, it doesn't matter what the results were, the results are

00:01:29.524 --> 00:01:34.246
not important. Another thing to consider in assessing the meaningfulness of

00:01:34.246 --> 00:01:38.520
results is the effect size. How large were the results? That doesn't meant that

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.352
small results are not important or that large results are necessarily

00:01:41.352 --> 00:01:45.954
important. But effect size is considered when assessing the meaningfulness of

00:01:45.954 --> 00:01:49.530
results. And it's possible for even very small effect sizes to be very

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.274
important. A final thing to consider is can we rule out random chance for the

00:01:53.274 --> 00:01:58.606
results? In other words, can we rule out sampling error as an explanation? Now,

00:01:58.606 --> 00:02:01.840
this doesn't guarantee that our results are important, but it goes along way to

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.001
helping us asses the rest of the import. Next, we need to know can we rule out

00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:09.586
alternative explanations for the results? These are those dreaded lurking

00:02:09.586 --> 00:02:13.300
variables we've been talking about before. So putting this all together, this

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.020
gives you a rough guideline of assessing whether the results of a study are

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.626
meaningful. What was measured, how large was the effect, could we rule out

00:02:21.626 --> 00:02:24.965
random chance as an explanation, and can we rule out lurking variables as an

00:02:24.965 --> 00:02:27.984
explanation for the results?
