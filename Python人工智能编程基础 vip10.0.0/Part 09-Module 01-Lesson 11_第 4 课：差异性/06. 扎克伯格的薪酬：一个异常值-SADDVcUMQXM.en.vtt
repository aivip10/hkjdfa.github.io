00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.698
&gt;&gt; Well now the range is 10 million minus 21,180. This makes the range

00:00:05.698 --> 00:00:12.435
9,978,820. That's a lot bigger than this range, just because we added one extra

00:00:12.435 --> 00:00:19.337
datum. Mark Zuckerburg is an outlier, and this significantly increases the range

00:00:19.337 --> 00:00:24.344
of our data. In general, outliers increase the variability, but way too much

00:00:24.344 --> 00:00:29.111
when we use the range as our measure. Therefore, the range may not accurately

00:00:29.111 --> 00:00:33.879
represent the variability of data, especially in the presence of outliers.
