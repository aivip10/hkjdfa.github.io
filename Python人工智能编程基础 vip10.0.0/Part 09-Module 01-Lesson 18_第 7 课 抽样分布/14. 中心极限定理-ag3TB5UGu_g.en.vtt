00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.106
Now remember what we are originally trying to find. We're trying to find where

00:00:05.106 --> 00:00:10.580
on the distribution of sample means a particular sample will lie. Not just for a

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.494
simple population like this one, but for a huge population. And now we can do

00:00:15.494 --> 00:00:20.876
that. Because now we know that the distribution of means, where every mean is

00:00:20.876 --> 00:00:26.710
the mean of a sample of size n. This distribution has a standard deviation equal

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.988
to the population standard deviation divided by the square root of n. This is

00:00:31.988 --> 00:00:36.815
called the central limit theorem. And it not only holds true for these simple

00:00:36.815 --> 00:00:42.775
populations but for any population. Because of the central limit theorem, we can

00:00:42.775 --> 00:00:47.284
have a population of any shape. And then let's say we draw a sample from it and

00:00:47.284 --> 00:00:51.252
calculate the mean, and then we draw another sample from it and calculate the

00:00:51.252 --> 00:00:57.878
mean. And we keep doing this, say a 100 times. Assuming the sample size is large

00:00:57.878 --> 00:01:02.438
enough, if we plot the distribution of means, we're going to get something

00:01:02.438 --> 00:01:07.435
that's relatively normal. With a standard deviation equal to the population

00:01:07.435 --> 00:01:12.901
standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size. And we've been

00:01:12.901 --> 00:01:18.650
calling it SE so far. And that's because this is called the standard error. This

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:24.326
is super cool, but I also understand that it's also super complicated. So we're

00:01:24.326 --> 00:01:28.886
going to go through a few more ways of looking at this, using applet's and

00:01:28.886 --> 00:01:33.750
demonstrations. And then finally at the end of this lesson, go over an example

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.463
where we would actually use this in real life.
