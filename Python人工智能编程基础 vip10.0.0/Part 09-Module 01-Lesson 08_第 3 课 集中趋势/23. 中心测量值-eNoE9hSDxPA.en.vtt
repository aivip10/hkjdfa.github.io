00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:06.564
&gt;&gt; You've done a lot so far and let's just summarize what happened when we added

00:00:06.564 --> 00:00:13.456
this outlier to the dataset. The mean changed from 47,718 when we just looked at

00:00:13.456 --> 00:00:20.225
these to 123,098 when we looked at all of them. However, the median only changed

00:00:20.225 --> 00:00:26.366
from 48,670 for that, to 50,915. This tendency of the median is called robust.

00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:32.335
In everyday language, robust means strong and sturdy, which makes sense for its

00:00:32.335 --> 00:00:38.441
statistical definition. It's not affected much by departures from the norm. So

00:00:38.441 --> 00:00:43.730
now, you've learned about the mean, the median, and the mode. These are all

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.138
measures of center because they typically describe the center of the

00:00:48.138 --> 00:00:53.120
distribution. As you've seen though sometimes, the mean doesn't describe the

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.761
center because of an outlier. Sometimes, the mode doesn't describe the center

00:00:57.761 --> 00:01:02.162
and the median doesn't take every data point into account. However, in the case

00:01:02.162 --> 00:01:06.718
of the starting salaries from the University of North Carolina, the median might

00:01:06.718 --> 00:01:11.073
have been a better statistic to determine what starting salary you would have

00:01:11.073 --> 00:01:15.851
made as a Geography major in the 1980s. The median is always the best measure of

00:01:15.851 --> 00:01:19.996
central tendency when dealing with highly skewed distributions.
