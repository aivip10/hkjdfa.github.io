00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:06.411
It's normal and that's not just a coincidence. So here you can see that the mean

00:00:06.411 --> 00:00:11.362
with the highest frequency is 2.5. This histogram might be a little confusing

00:00:11.362 --> 00:00:16.667
since it's discrete. But if you look back at your sample means, you see that you

00:00:16.667 --> 00:00:21.992
get four samples that have a mean of 2.5. Ideally, 2.5 would be right here in

00:00:21.992 --> 00:00:28.533
the center. But you see that it's more rare to get a sample mean of 1 or 4.
