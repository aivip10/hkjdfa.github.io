00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.924
What if we got different mean engagement and learning scores for our sample.

00:00:04.924 --> 00:00:09.110
And calculated that the probability of getting these means is 5% for engagement

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.980
and 10% for learning? Here I just put something. We could actually calculate

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.756
what these mean values would be? Given the probability of getting those means,

00:00:17.756 --> 00:00:22.397
but that's not really important. The question here is, how about these

00:00:22.397 --> 00:00:27.488
probability values? Are these likely or unlikely? And remember, these are your

00:00:27.488 --> 00:00:32.232
ideas. What would you consider likely or unlikely?
