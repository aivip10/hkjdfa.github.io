&gt;&gt; So you've seen then that we can visualize data with histograms. You learned

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.977
that a few lessons ago. And we can also visualize data with box plots, which

00:00:08.977 --> 00:00:13.830
shows specifically the median, the interquartile range, the min and max value.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.843
And remember that the distance between these is the range. So now I'm going to

00:00:18.843 --> 00:00:25.235
ask you a conceptual question. Will the mean always be between Q1 and Q3? Yes or

00:00:25.235 --> 00:00:25.541
no?
