The earliest known academic rating about the meaning of random was by John Venn

00:00:04.457 --> 00:00:08.650
in 1888 and his book called the logic of chance. He said, Perhaps the best

00:00:08.662 --> 00:00:12.541
typical example that we can give of the scientific meaning of random

00:00:12.553 --> 00:00:17.099
distribution is afforded by the arrangement of the drops of rain in a shower. No

00:00:17.111 --> 00:00:21.430
one can give a guess whereabouts at any instant a drop will fall, but we know

00:00:21.442 --> 00:00:25.837
that if we put out a sheet of paper it will gradually become uniformly spotted

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.473
over. And if we were to mark out any two equal areas on the paper, these would

00:00:30.485 --> 00:00:34.880
gradually tend to be struck equally often. Therefore, when we have a random

00:00:34.892 --> 00:00:39.504
sample, each subject has an equal chance of being selected. And then our sample

00:00:39.516 --> 00:00:42.111
is more likely to approximate the population.
