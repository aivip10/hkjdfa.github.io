00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.486
I'm going to use red to represent wrong and green to represent correct. If it

00:00:05.486 --> 00:00:09.840
turns out the null is true, and there's no significant difference. But we

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.437
reject the null, that's making the wrong statistical decision. However, if the

00:00:14.437 --> 00:00:18.154
null is true, and then we decide based on the result of our sample, that we're

00:00:18.154 --> 00:00:23.826
going to retain the null. Then we made the correct decision. Similarly if the

00:00:23.826 --> 00:00:29.883
null is false, and then we reject it, we've also made the correct decision. But

00:00:29.883 --> 00:00:34.382
if the null is false and the treatment actually did have an affect. But we

00:00:34.382 --> 00:00:39.112
assumed otherwise, then we're making the wrong decision. It's always possible

00:00:39.112 --> 00:00:44.440
to make the wrong decision. But we minimize our chances of doing so, when we

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.111
have a large enough sample size. When we randomize our sample, and when we

00:00:49.111 --> 00:00:54.290
implement proper experimental controls. If we reject the null when the null is

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.896
actually true, and we conclude that there was a treatment effect. We commit a

00:00:59.896 --> 00:01:04.861
type I error. I'm writing in Roman numerals. And if we fail to reject the null

00:01:04.861 --> 00:01:09.415
even though it's false, this is called a type II error.
