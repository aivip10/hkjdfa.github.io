You just created a histragram with bin size 20, but we can create a histagram

00:00:05.137 --> 00:00:10.150
with any bin size, or also called the interval size. This is interactivate

00:00:10.162 --> 00:00:15.450
histagram software, which I really like. You can just input the data here, and

00:00:15.462 --> 00:00:20.650
then you can see how the shape of the histagram changes when you change the bin

00:00:20.662 --> 00:00:26.332
size. So here, we're getting bigger and bigger bins. And you see that there are

00:00:26.344 --> 00:00:31.766
more observations now within each interval. If we keep making the bin size

00:00:31.778 --> 00:00:36.979
bigger and bigger, eventually it gets kind of hard to see the shape of the

00:00:36.991 --> 00:00:42.923
histogram because the bin sizes are too big. So here, the bin size is about 23.

00:00:43.682 --> 00:00:50.283
And if we keep going, of course, eventually, we get way too much data in each

00:00:50.295 --> 00:00:56.821
bin, and the shape of the histogram isn't even recognizable. So, let's get a

00:00:56.833 --> 00:01:03.359
smaller bin size. Here, you can kind of see better the shape of the histogram,

00:01:03.495 --> 00:01:09.463
that it peaks at around age 20. And so, it's really up to you to decide what bin

00:01:09.475 --> 00:01:15.200
size you want, and it all depends on what questions you want to answer. How much

00:01:15.212 --> 00:01:20.721
detail you want. because at some point, the bin size is probably too small, but

00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:26.058
at some point the bin size is probably too big. In this software, you can also

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.900
see that the sample size is 50. You can see the average. And we're going to get

00:01:30.912 --> 00:01:36.030
to these statistics later. The link to this software is on the right, so you can

00:01:36.042 --> 00:01:40.559
click on it and input the data. We shared this data with you in a Google

00:01:40.571 --> 00:01:45.542
spreadsheet. And then, you can see for yourself how the shape of the histogram

00:01:45.554 --> 00:01:47.877
changes when you change the bin size.
