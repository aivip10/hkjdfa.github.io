00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.218
All of these are down sides to surveys. We can't always be sure that respondents

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:10.361
are answering truthfully. Even if surveys are anonymous, people don't always

00:00:10.373 --> 00:00:15.164
give the truth for some reason. It's probably a psychological thing, and

00:00:15.176 --> 00:00:20.494
oftentimes, without realizing it, we give biased answers. Everyone has their own

00:00:20.506 --> 00:00:25.250
bias based on where they grew up, the experiences that they went through, their

00:00:25.262 --> 00:00:29.865
beliefs and values. When respondents don't understand the questions, we get

00:00:29.877 --> 00:00:34.637
what's called response bias. That's why it's very important for those who write

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.257
the survey to be very precise in their wording. And finally, some people just

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:43.705
refuse to answer, they don't feel comfortable answering that or they're

00:00:43.717 --> 00:00:48.593
incapable of doing so. There might be a certain group of people who don't answer

00:00:48.605 --> 00:00:52.998
the questions, and therefore, the data that we get from the survey doesn't

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.879
accurately represent them. When certain people refuse to answer, this is called

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.530
non-response bias. Remember when we talked about contructs? Surveys are often

00:01:03.542 --> 00:01:08.907
used to analyze constructs. And like I told you, I analyzed the construct

00:01:08.919 --> 00:01:14.776
effort. As you've seen, there isn't just one definition of a construct, there

00:01:14.788 --> 00:01:19.785
are many. Therefore, it's crucial to use as subjective measurements as possible.

00:01:19.887 --> 00:01:23.310
Surveys really have to be carefully thought out and worded.
