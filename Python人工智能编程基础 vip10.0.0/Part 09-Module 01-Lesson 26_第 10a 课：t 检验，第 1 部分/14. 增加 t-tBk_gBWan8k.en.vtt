00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.846
If this difference increases then that means that the whole t statistic will

00:00:04.846 --> 00:00:11.108
increase. If x increases that means that the denominator is increasing and then

00:00:11.108 --> 00:00:17.450
that will cause t to decrease. A larger n will result in a smaller standard

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:23.658
error, in other words a decreased denominator. And that means that the

00:00:23.658 --> 00:00:28.412
t-statistic will increase. And if the whole standard error increases, then that

00:00:28.412 --> 00:00:33.140
means the t-statistic will decrease. Going backwards the larger the

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.726
t-statistic, the higher it is on the t-distribution and the lower the

00:00:36.726 --> 00:00:42.626
probability of obtaining that t-statistic. And then the larger the difference

00:00:42.626 --> 00:00:47.286
between means that we would expect. This same concept applies to negative t

00:00:47.286 --> 00:00:48.620
statistics.
