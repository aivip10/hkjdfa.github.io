Now this is a really important concept, and we're going to try to drive this

00:00:04.352 --> 00:00:09.080
point home. Thomas Friedman said in his book, The Lexus and the Olive Tree, that

00:00:09.092 --> 00:00:13.395
no two countries with a McDonald's have ever gone to war since opening the

00:00:13.407 --> 00:00:17.855
McDonald's. This is called the Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention.

00:00:17.957 --> 00:00:22.850
Let's just assume that after hearing Thomas Friedman's observation Policy makers

00:00:22.862 --> 00:00:27.725
concluded that if every country built at least one McDonald's, we would attain

00:00:27.737 --> 00:00:32.320
world peace. Well, what could be a plausible explanation for Friedman's

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:37.265
observation, and which would lend for different policy conclusions? Let's ask

00:00:37.277 --> 00:00:39.000
some people what they think.
