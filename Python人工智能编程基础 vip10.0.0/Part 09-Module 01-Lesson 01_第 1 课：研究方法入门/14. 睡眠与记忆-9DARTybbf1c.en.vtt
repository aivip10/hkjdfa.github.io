The answer, if this were true, is that the more you sleep, the better your

00:00:04.662 --> 00:00:09.435
memory. People who didn't sleep for very long got lower scores. People that

00:00:09.447 --> 00:00:14.320
slept for longer, more than 6 hours, got better scores. So, if all the data

00:00:14.332 --> 00:00:19.455
followed this pattern, we could reasonably conclude that the more you sleep, the

00:00:19.467 --> 00:00:20.662
better your memory tends to be.
