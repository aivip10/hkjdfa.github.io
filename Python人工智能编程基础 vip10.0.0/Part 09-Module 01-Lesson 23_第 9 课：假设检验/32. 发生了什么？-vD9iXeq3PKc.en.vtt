00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.994
Hopefully these last two examples illustrated the concept of type I and type II

00:00:03.994 --> 00:00:08.490
errors. But now to wrap up this lesson, let's apply type I and type II errors

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.820
to the question of whether or not a musical lesson will increase engagement.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.293
Remember that our population parameter was 7.47 and this is from the actual

00:00:18.293 --> 00:00:24.640
responses from the survey that I sent out. And the actual population standard

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.112
deviation was 2.41. Our new hypothesis, then, will be that the new population

00:00:30.112 --> 00:00:34.626
mean after the intervention will not have a significant change from this

00:00:34.626 --> 00:00:40.427
population parameter. In other words, there won't be a treatment effect. And

00:00:40.427 --> 00:00:44.606
the alternative hypothesis is that there is a treatment effect. So the two

00:00:44.606 --> 00:00:49.828
parameters will be significantly different. Now let's say that we have a sample

00:00:49.828 --> 00:00:54.692
of size 30, and the mean engagement is 8.3, however the true engagement of the

00:00:54.692 --> 00:01:02.100
population if we were to implement this musical lesson, will be 7.8. Now in

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.252
real life we don't know what muse sub song will be but let's pretend we do. If

00:01:07.252 --> 00:01:12.268
this happens, then which of these four quadrants represents the results of our

00:01:12.268 --> 00:01:17.128
hypothesis test? This is a pretty tough question and it requires you to

00:01:17.128 --> 00:01:20.548
remember what we did before and then really understand Type I and Type II

00:01:20.548 --> 00:01:26.256
errors. Give it your best shot. Let's say our alpha level is 0.05 and this is

00:01:26.256 --> 00:01:28.411
for a two-tailed test.
