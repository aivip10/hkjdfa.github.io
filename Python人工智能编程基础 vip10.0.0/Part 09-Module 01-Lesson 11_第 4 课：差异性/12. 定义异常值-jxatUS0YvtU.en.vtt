00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:08.320
&gt;&gt; A value is considered an outlier if it is less than the first quartile minus

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:16.574
1.5 times the IQR. Or if it's greater than Q3 plus 1.5 times the IQR. So here

00:00:16.574 --> 00:00:24.890
you've found that the inter-quartile range was 4,944. And you know that Q1 is

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:32.418
49,191 and Q3 is 54,135. So, using this universally accepted definition of

00:00:32.418 --> 00:00:39.663
outliers. Statisticaly decide which of these are considered outliers.
