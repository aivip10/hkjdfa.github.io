00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.040
&gt;&gt; When you fouind Q3 minus Q1 you were calculating what we call the

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.528
interquartile range abbreviated IQR. I defnitelly don'talways want to write that

00:00:09.528 --> 00:00:13.518
out. Iqr is a lot easier. So now you're going to take a quiz on the

00:00:13.518 --> 00:00:18.933
interquartile range. True of false? About 50% of the data falls within the IQR?

00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:23.884
The IQR is affected by every value in the data set. And finally, the IQR is not

00:00:23.884 --> 00:00:28.882
affected by outliers. So based on what you've learned about the inter quartile

00:00:28.882 --> 00:00:30.975
range, give this your best shot.
