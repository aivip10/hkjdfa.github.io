00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.437
Here's another quiz. If we standardize a distribution by converting every value

00:00:05.437 --> 00:00:10.865
to a z-score, what will be the new mean of this standardized distribution? This

00:00:10.865 --> 00:00:15.968
is a pretty difficult question, so if you get it, then you should definitely

00:00:15.968 --> 00:00:21.201
brag about it in the forums. As a hint, just think again about how we calculate

00:00:21.201 --> 00:00:25.923
z-scores. Any value on the axis minus the mean divided by the standard

00:00:25.923 --> 00:00:30.825
deviation. And think also, in the previous videos, we showed how we take any

00:00:30.825 --> 00:00:35.437
normal distribution and then we standardize it. So you might want to replay

00:00:35.437 --> 00:00:40.073
those videos, if you don't know the answer right now, because those might help

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:42.681
you figure out what the new mean will be.
