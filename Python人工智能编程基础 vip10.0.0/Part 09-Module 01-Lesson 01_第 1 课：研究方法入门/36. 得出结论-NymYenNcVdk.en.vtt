Well, this first one doesn't work. It's not really feasible, because your nails

00:00:05.571 --> 00:00:10.964
grow independent of how long your hand is. We also can't assert this second one.

00:00:11.078 --> 00:00:16.521
We can't simply say that taller people have longer hands. In fact, if we look at

00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:21.965
the data, these two people look like they have about the same height. But they

00:00:21.977 --> 00:00:27.815
have very different hand lengths, therefore we can't say with certainty that

00:00:27.827 --> 00:00:33.580
taller people automatically have longer hands. There's just a trend in that

00:00:33.592 --> 00:00:39.470
direction. Also if we look at this trend, we see that people that have about my

00:00:39.482 --> 00:00:45.789
hand length, which is 6.75. Tend to have heights around this area. Seven feet is

00:00:45.801 --> 00:00:51.934
84 inches, which is way up here. Therefore, it's very unlikely that I'm taller

00:00:51.946 --> 00:00:58.318
than 7 feet. But I could be. Remember, this relationship shows a correlation,

00:00:58.443 --> 00:01:04.190
not a causation. therefore we can't draw this conclusion, however we can say

00:01:04.202 --> 00:01:08.615
with certainty that people who have longer hands tend to be taller
