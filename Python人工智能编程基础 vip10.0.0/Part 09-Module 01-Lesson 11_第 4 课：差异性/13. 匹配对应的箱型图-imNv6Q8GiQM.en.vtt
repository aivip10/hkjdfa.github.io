00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:06.187
&gt;&gt; We visualize quartiles and outliers with box plots also called box and whisker

00:00:06.187 --> 00:00:11.492
plots. It looks like this, where this line represents the min. This line

00:00:11.492 --> 00:00:17.209
repressents the locatin of Q1. This line represents of Q2 or the median. This

00:00:17.209 --> 00:00:23.276
line repsresents the locatin of Q3. And this line is the max, and then, outliers

00:00:23.276 --> 00:00:29.769
are represented by dots in their respective location. Boxplots can also be drawn

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:36.009
sideways like this, with the minimum value, the median, Q1 and Q3, and then the

00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:42.463
maximum value, with dots that represent the outliers. Given that information,

00:00:42.463 --> 00:00:48.553
which of these boxplots do you think corresponds to these distributions? This

00:00:48.553 --> 00:00:54.746
one with and without Mark Zuckerberg, and this general population distribution.

00:00:54.746 --> 00:01:00.175
And just a hint, this dot right here is an outlier. So, type A, B, or C into

00:01:00.175 --> 00:01:04.660
each of these red boxes, corresponding to these boxplots.
