00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.356
For this, we'll have to use the z table. So if 5% is above the C score, then

00:00:05.356 --> 00:00:12.718
that means 95% has to be below the z score. So let's look in the table and find

00:00:12.718 --> 00:00:20.278
.95. So in the body of the table again, we have the probability. Less than a

00:00:20.278 --> 00:00:24.422
certain z score. This is the same as the proportion of values in the

00:00:24.422 --> 00:00:29.730
population, less than a certain z score. Let's zoom in a little. Here we have

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:40.146
0.9495, and 0.9505. Hopefully you can see that. 0.95 is in between those. So if

00:00:40.146 --> 00:00:46.900
you said either 1.64 or 1.65 then you got it right. Let's just say its about

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.824
1.65.
