00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:06.518
&gt;&gt; If we look at this graph, it looks like 50,000 splits the data in half. So,

00:00:06.518 --> 00:00:13.388
we have about 500 values on this side and 500 on this side. 500 split in half is

00:00:13.388 --> 00:00:19.878
250. So, we know that the first quartile has to occur when there are 250 values,

00:00:19.878 --> 00:00:24.520
Which will be somewhere here. This is to the right of 25,000.
