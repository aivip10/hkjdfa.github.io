00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.462
&gt;&gt; What do we mean by this? If we look at the middle number in this data, so

00:00:04.462 --> 00:00:09.390
let's cross off the top and bottom and let's cross off the next top and bottom,

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:14.336
and we're left with the middle. The middle number in each of these data don't

00:00:14.336 --> 00:00:19.386
really represent the data. In fact, they're the smallest value in each of these

00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:24.001
columns. So, what do we need to do to make the median a useful statistic that

00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:28.985
can actually represent the data? Calculate the average? Put the data in order?

00:00:28.985 --> 00:00:32.679
Eliminate outliers? Or eliminate data values that repeat?
