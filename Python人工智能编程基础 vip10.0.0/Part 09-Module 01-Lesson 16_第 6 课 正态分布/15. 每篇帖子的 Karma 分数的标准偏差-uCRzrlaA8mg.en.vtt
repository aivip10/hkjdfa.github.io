00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.331
This one probably took you a little longer to figure out, and that's okay. So,

00:00:04.331 --> 00:00:08.489
you remember that the first thing we have to do is find the deviation from the

00:00:08.489 --> 00:00:12.651
mean for each of these values. So, let's do it in cell B1. We found that the

00:00:12.651 --> 00:00:17.997
mean was approximately 12.96. So, I'll write equals A1 minus 12.96. And that

00:00:17.997 --> 00:00:23.763
will give us the deviation of the first value from the mean. Now, we'll copy

00:00:23.763 --> 00:00:29.169
this so that we don't have to write it in every cell. And then, if you go to

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:35.121
cell A1 and push Cmd+Down, at least on a Mac keyboard, and then we'll go to cell

00:00:35.121 --> 00:00:41.352
B200 and then push Cmd+Shift+Up Arrow key, then you should have the whole column

00:00:41.352 --> 00:00:47.353
B highlighted. Now, write Cmd+V and then you have all of the deviations for each

00:00:47.353 --> 00:00:53.059
of those values. Something else that you may have done in which I taught you

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:58.701
before, was going to this corner until you see the plus and then dragging it

00:00:58.701 --> 00:01:04.712
down. And if you did that, that's perfectly fine. These are just some keyboard

00:01:04.712 --> 00:01:10.883
shortcuts that make our life a little easier. So, in column C now, let's square

00:01:10.883 --> 00:01:17.417
each of the deviations, so we'll write equals B1 carrot 2, which means squared,

00:01:17.417 --> 00:01:23.654
and then again, we'll Copy cell C1, go to cell B1, push Cmd+Down Arrow key, to

00:01:23.654 --> 00:01:30.207
go to the bottom. Go to cell C200, push Cmd+Shift+Up Arrow key, so that we have

00:01:30.207 --> 00:01:36.135
all of column C highlighted, and then, Cmd+V. And now, we have all of our

00:01:36.135 --> 00:01:42.697
squared deviations. So, what's the next thing we do? We have to sum them up. So,

00:01:42.697 --> 00:01:48.894
let's do that in cell D1, equals sum of C1 colon C200. So, we added up our score

00:01:48.894 --> 00:01:54.939
deviations and now this time, and this is where the sample standard deviation

00:01:54.939 --> 00:02:01.170
differs from the population standard deviation, we'll divide this by n minus 1,

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.221
which is 199 equals D1 divided by 199. And then, our last step is to take the

00:02:07.221 --> 00:02:13.882
square root, equal sqrt of D2. So, we get that our sample standard deviation is

00:02:13.882 --> 00:02:20.447
approximately 4.76, and this is our best estimate of the population standard

00:02:20.447 --> 00:02:21.463
deviation.
