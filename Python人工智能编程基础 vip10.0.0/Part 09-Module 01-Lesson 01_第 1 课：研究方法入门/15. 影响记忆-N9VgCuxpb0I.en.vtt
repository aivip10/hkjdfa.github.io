00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.885
So definitely, the time of day that you took the test could have influenced your

00:00:03.897 --> 00:00:07.712
memory. If you're taking the test late at night, you might be really tired, or

00:00:07.724 --> 00:00:11.431
maybe your brain just doesn't work in the morning, like one of my friends. He

00:00:11.443 --> 00:00:15.125
can't think at all in the morning. That isn't to say that it definitely did

00:00:15.137 --> 00:00:18.927
influence your memory, but it could have. The number of palm trees in Hawaii

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.980
isn't very plausible to have influenced your memory. Your stress level

00:00:22.992 --> 00:00:28.133
definitely could have influenced your memory. If you're really stressed, maybe

00:00:28.145 --> 00:00:33.269
you don't remember as well. The price of milk, not so plausible. The five minute

00:00:33.281 --> 00:00:38.380
breaks? Absolutely. If you didn't take the five minute breaks, my hunch is that

00:00:38.392 --> 00:00:43.930
it might be more difficult to remember which face was from part 1 or part 2. The

00:00:43.942 --> 00:00:50.055
Mass of Pluto, not so much. Your age? Definitely. And finally, not paying

00:00:50.067 --> 00:00:56.460
attention, definitely could have influenced your memory. And the BBC study

00:00:56.472 --> 00:01:01.945
concluded that age and time of day were the two biggest influencers on how well

00:01:01.957 --> 00:01:06.658
people performed on this memory test, if you didn't get a chance to see the BBC

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.321
test results. So, we're looking at a bunch of different things that could have

00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:15.800
influenced your memory, including sleep. We make hypotheses all the time,

00:01:15.904 --> 00:01:16.252
everyday.
