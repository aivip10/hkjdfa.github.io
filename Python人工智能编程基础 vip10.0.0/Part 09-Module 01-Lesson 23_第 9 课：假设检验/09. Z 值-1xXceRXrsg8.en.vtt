00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.310
So let's get back to this example, where I would sing about this concept, and

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.223
we want to know if it's going to help students learn and increase their

00:00:07.223 --> 00:00:13.454
engagement. But let's pretend that after I sing, the 20 students exposed to

00:00:13.454 --> 00:00:20.118
this lesson report a mean engagement score of 7.13. So remember, they're rating

00:00:20.118 --> 00:00:23.962
their engagement from 1 to 10, and then we're going to take the average rating

00:00:23.962 --> 00:00:29.202
of those 20 students, and we get 7.13. For now, let's not focus on student

00:00:29.202 --> 00:00:34.460
learning. So first of all, what should the z score be for this sample mean?

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.452
Just to remind you we're pretending that the population mean was 7.5, and the

00:00:39.452 --> 00:00:45.697
population standard deviation was 0.64. So, remember, when we find the z score

00:00:45.697 --> 00:00:51.170
of a sample mean, we look at it compared to the whole sampling distribution
