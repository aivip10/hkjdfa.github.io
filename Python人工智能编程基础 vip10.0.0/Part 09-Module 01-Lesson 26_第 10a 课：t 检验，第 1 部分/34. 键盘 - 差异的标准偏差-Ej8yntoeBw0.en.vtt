00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.195
Now we need to find what s is? And in this case we're finding the standard

00:00:04.195 --> 00:00:08.852
deviation of each difference. So bring up your spread sheet and in this column

00:00:08.852 --> 00:00:13.621
calculate the difference. And then find the standard deviation using the

00:00:13.621 --> 00:00:17.853
denominator n minus 1. And then write what you get for s.
