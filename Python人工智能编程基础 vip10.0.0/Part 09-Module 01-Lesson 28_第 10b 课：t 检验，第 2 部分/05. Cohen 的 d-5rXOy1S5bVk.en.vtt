00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.436
We've already talked a little bit about Cohen's d named after the statistician

00:00:03.436 --> 00:00:07.695
Jacob Cohen. Cohen's d is an effect size measure, which gives us the

00:00:07.695 --> 00:00:12.530
standardized mean difference. let's break this apart. We already know what it a

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.780
mean difference is. Mean difference is simply the difference between two means.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.599
For example, between X bar and mu, as in the one-sample z-test and the

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:26.257
one-sample t-test. The word standardized, you may recall from our discussion of

00:00:26.257 --> 00:00:30.273
z-scores. Remember, when we called z-scores standardized scores, what that

00:00:30.273 --> 00:00:33.628
meant was we were taking a difference between a raw score and the mean, and

00:00:33.628 --> 00:00:39.582
dividing by the standard deviation. Cohen's d does something very similar. It

00:00:39.582 --> 00:00:43.913
takes a difference in this case, in the one sample case between X bar and Mu

00:00:43.913 --> 00:00:49.790
and it divides by the standard deviation of the sample. So, it's called the

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.390
standardized mean difference because we have a mean difference and then it's

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.808
turned into standard deviation unit. So, the interpretation of Cohen's d is how

00:00:57.808 --> 00:01:03.700
far apart these means are in standard deviation units.
